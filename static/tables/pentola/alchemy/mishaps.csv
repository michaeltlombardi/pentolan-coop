1,"**Disorienting:** The formula is 'successful' but includes a side effect which makes all Flax tests hard for the duration."
2,"**Overpowered:** This batch of the formula is more powerful intended with double the magnitude. However, it makes up for this extra magnitude with Tephra from whoever uses the batch as the included ingredients cannot supply it."
3,"**Euphoria:** The formula is made correctly, but to take any of it will induce a state of extreme euphoria for the duration in addition to any other effects."
4,"**Blood Bubbling:** The batch causes the blood to turn partially to gas in the body of anyone who takes it, inducing terrible pain and halving their Bone rating for the duration."
5,"**Vanishing:** The batch hardens and then crumbles into infinitely small grains, dispersing at the slightest motion."
6,"**Giggling:** The formula is made correctly, but unpredictably causes a debilititating fit of the giggles (opposed test each moment) for the duration."
7,"**Fulmination:** The experiment literally blows up as the magic energies mix with too much volatility, inflicting M damage on those who are nearby."
8,"**Burning:** The formula burns uncontrollably, igniting a hot conflagration that consumes the ingredients and possibly nearby equipment."
9,"**Sickening:** The formula is a failure, noxious gases escaping and causing everyone nearby to vomit uncontrollably for a minute."
‚òÄÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è," **Necrotizing:** This batch bubbles over and expands violently, seeking out living flesh nearby and causing it to begin to rot immediately."
üåë,"**Tephratic Inversion:** The experiment goes horribly awry as magic itself burns out, drawing all nearby magic and energy into it at a rate of 3 Tephra / moment. When the Tephra is drained from nearby creatures and items, it instead drains Blood until death or escape. When a minute has passed when no more Tephra can be drained, the nexus winks out."
0,"**Puddling:** The noxious particles from this failed batch destabilize any solids they come in contact with, causing them to liquify."

When attacking, the _singles_ result of your roll determines the damage dealt (so a roll of a 34 would deal 4 damage).
When an attack is a triumph, ignore all armor and deal the face value of the roll (so a triumph of 07 would deal 7 damage, ignoring all AP).
Remember that AP and parrying can reduce incoming damage to zero.

Weapons and shields have a rating.
After every combat where a weapon is used in a successful attack but neals no damage due to the target's armor, roll a dz%; if over the weapon's rating, reduce it by one significant numeral.

You can use your shield to block an incoming attack, reducing the rating by one significant numeral to negate all incoming damage if you succeed on the opposed test.

The value of a weapon or shield is determined by its rating and may be modified by its qualities.

{{< detail mechanical "Weapons and Pricing" >}}
The default rules here make weapons much more costly and valuable, especially when compared to other games.
This is because weapons are not normally acquired by general citizens‚Äîplayer characters tend to get involved in all sorts of trouble and adventures that most citizens try very hard to avoid.
Weapons also make for pretty good treasure and can be traded for other equipment because of their expense.

You could make acquiring weapons cheaper by removing the usage die cost, but be mindful that weapons are some of the most plentiful items the characters may be finding, if your game leans towards violent conflicts.

### Weapon Qualities

- **Cheap:** Weapons with this quality always countt as V1 when being bought or sold.
- **Concealable:** Weapons with this quality are easy to conceal and can be hidden in your clothes and armor.
- **Heavy:** Weapons with this quality count twice for encumbrance and, when attacking, ignore the target's AP up to the significant numeral of your roll (so a 34 would deal 4 damage and ignore up to 3AP).
- **Light:** Weapons with this quality do not count for encumbrance, but do the lesser damage of the faces of the dice (so a 34 would deal 3 damage).
- **Encumbering:** Carrying any shield with this quality makes athletics-related actions and tests to resist fatigue one step harder.
- **Reach:** Weapons with this quality are longer than most, allowing you to keep an opponent at a distance, meaning they'll have to successfully close with you in order to use their weapon.
- **Balanced:** Weapons with this quality are designed to be thrown and may be used against nearby targets in addition to close ones.
- **Ranged:** Weapons with this quality are designed to shoot ammunition at an enemy who is distant or closer.
  You can also shoot at enemies who are Far Away, but the test is one step harder.
  You can parry a melee attack with a ranged weapon but its rating automatically decreases by one significant numeral.
- **Expensive:** Weapons with this quality have double their normal value and cost twice as much to repair.
- **Easily Repairable:** Weapons with this quality are easier and cheaper to repair; roll twice on the usage die when repairing it yourself or make only one wealth roll to have it repaired to full if being done professionally.
- **Slow (X):** Weapons with this quality are slow to reload and require X actions to do so.
- **Fashionable:** Weapons with this quality makes relevant social tests one step easier‚Äîpeople perceive the wearer as more wealthy and high status.

### Masterwork and Magic Weapons

As with armor there's no distinction between masterwork weapons and magical ones.

Particularly skilled artisans might create items which are more resilient, deal more damage, add or remove qualities, or grant new special abilities.
Unless otherwise specified, magical abilities increase the value by 2.

{{< detail example "A Sampling of Magic Weapons" >}}
Here a few examples of magical armor created by artisans:

- **Spireblade:** Rating üåë6, Fashionable (Vüåë).
  This elegant bronze blade has been lovingly crafted by a spire artisan and has the Spire's name engraved into it.
  The handle is wrapped in sharksin and the pommel is polished crystal which glows ever so slightly.
- **Mageglass Dagger:** Rating 96, Expensive (V16).
  This blackglass dagger is born of stone from the heart of a volcano, the handle wrapped in silver silk.
  It functions as a dagger against most opponents, but against demons it deals triple damage.
- **Storm Spear:** Rating 96 (Vüåë)).
  This spear's shaft is made from a dark hardwood, the head of the spear gleams in the light and the whole thing vibrates slightly during stormy weather.
  When thrown the spear becomes a bolt of lightning dealing 6 damage to everything in its path (ignoring AP), returning to the wielder's hand at the beginning of the next moment, and automatically decreases the Storm Spear's rating by one significant numeral.
- **Mirror Shield:** Rating üåë6 (V11).
  This bronze round shield is polished to a literal mirror sheen and has small runes inscribed around the edges in a tiny iron rim.
  In addition to blocking normal attacks, this shield can be used to reflect magic attacks back at an enemy.
  When using the shield this way, reduce the rating by one significant numeral as if blocking an attack.
- **Sniper Sling:** No rating (V3).
  This sling is innocuous except for the black stitching weaving through it.
  This sling may be used against any enemy who the wielder can see, no matter the range.
- **Majestic Trout:** Rating 96 (Vüåë).
  This solid bronze statue of a trout with its mouth agape flops in the hand, acting as something akin to a flail.
  Attacks with the majestic trout cannot be parried, only blocked or dodged.

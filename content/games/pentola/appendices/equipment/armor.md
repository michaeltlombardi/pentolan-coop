Armor provides protection (AP) by reducing all incoming damage.
When taking damage from an attack reduce the incoming damage by the AP.
However, heavier armors impose penalties, making some tests one step harder.

Armors also have a rating which must be rolled after every combat in which damage was taken that the armor did not completely absorb.
If the roll is over its rating, the rating is decreased by a significant numeral.
If this would bring the rating to zero or below, the armor is destroyed beyond repair.

Damaged armor can be repaired by a skilled artisan, the value of this labor equal to the repairs needed.

When purchasing armor, its base value is equal to the AP the armor provides plus the significant numeral of its rating, unless it has the cheap or expensive qualities.

{{< detail example "Armor In Play" >}}
Taryn started play with a padded shirt (AP 1, rating 26, cheap).
Their total AP is 1‚Äîunless an enemy makes a called strike to an unprotected area, all incoming physical damage will be reduced by 1 automatically.
After a fight where they were hurt, Taryn must roll for their armor to see if it has been damaged.
They roll a 55 and the rating falls to 16.

Taryn can take their padded shirt to be repaired (Value 1) or attempt to repair it themself.

Later, Taryn acquires a plated cap (AP 1, rating 46) and decides to wear it, increasing their AP to 2.

### Types of Armor

- **Shirt:** Shirts of armor cover your torso and upper arms, falling to just about your hips.
- **Skirt:** Skirts of armor cover your waist and upper legs, stopping at around the knees.
- **Vambraces:** Vambraces cover your forearms.
- **Helm:** Helms come in two broad categories, open and closed.
  Open helms cover the top of your head, the back, and your cheeks.
  Closed helms cover your whole head but at a cost of making it harder to hear and see.
  Most closed helms have an option to open them up, allowing you to improve protection for combat without spending all day hard of hearing.
  Both types of helm include neck flaps to protect the back of the neck.
- **Cap:** Caps cover the top of your head and do not do much to protect the sides or back.
- **Breastplate:** Breastplates cover the front and back of your torso as well as the tops of your shoulders.
- **Hauberk:** Hauberks cover your chest, arms, and upper thighs as a sort of very large shirt.
- **Trews:** Trews cover your legs.
- **Greaves:** Greaves cover your calves.

{{< detail mechanical "Additional Types of Armor" >}}
There's dozens of other ways to break down armor into smaller pieces‚Äîfeel free to provide alternate types of armor wherever you want, just be mindful of total AP and cost.
The list above isn't comprehensive, but it's about as many useful distinctions as we felt could be added without pushing choice paralysis on players.

### Armor Materials

- **Bone:** In Pentola, armor made of strips of hard bone sewn to drakeleather backing are common and reasonably affordable for common soldiers.
  Bone armor is made from drakebone, from whalebone, and from imported sources such as horse.
- **Enamelled:** Wealthy folks in Pentola with a flair for fashion will often purchase enamelled armor made of drakeleather and treated with lacquer and alchemical reagents to stiffen the armor and make it amenable to extensive decoration.
  Most enamelled armor is worn over padded shirt and trews and is made bespoke for the owner.
- **Padded:** Padded armor is made of many layers of cloth stiffened in water from the canals to provide cheap but reasonable protection from edged weapons.
- **Plate:** Shaped plates of bronze provide superior protection for the wearer at the cost of weight and high value.
  Polished to a shine and often tooled with decoration, plate armor is the pinacle of armor for professional warriors and marines.
  It's resistant to water and relatively easy to repair, compared to enamelled armor, though less fashion-forward.
  It is normally worn over padded shirt and trews to provide some coverage for the gaps in the armor.
  Suits of bronze armor are expensive, especially if bespoke, though more generic pieces are available due to demand from military forces.
- **Scale:** Armor made of small overlapping bronze plates sewn to drakeleather provides very good protection and is relatively affordable.
  It requires both more and less maintenance as individual scales can be replaced if damaged.
  It's cheaper than plate or enamelled armor because it can be produced in a few sizes to accommodate numerous bodies.
  It's therefore also easier to loot from an enemy.
- **Linen:** Linen armor is made of layers of glued linen formed into bands and sewn together to provide cheap, reasonable armor for common soldiers and folks who fight mostly on land.

{{< detail mechanical "Tweaking Armor Materials" >}}
Pentola assumes a high-magic bronze age urban center full of artisans and dozens of cultures mashing up together to create a metropolis.
There's no reason characters couldn't come across armor materials considered exotic for Pentola‚Äîsharkskin, griffin wool, etc.
Be mindful that there's no indigenous domesticated mammals in the city and surrounding areas‚Äîno cows, sheep, pigs, or horses‚Äîso normal leather is a luxury good imported from elsewhere.
Highlight items made from those materials as higher status or remarkable, because Pentolans would think of them that way.

Particularly notable here, as with the rest of the setting, is the relative scarcity of iron.
Iron is mostly used for it's anti-demon properties‚Äîthis world does not have steel manufacture but does have plentiful sources of copper and tin for bronze.
In Pentola, adding iron to armor and other equipment is incredibly expensive and often is more valuable as a component for magic and anti-demon applications.

### Armor Qualities

- **Expensive:** Armor with this quality must be made to order; it is twice as valuable as normal and costs twice as much to repair.
- **Cheap:** Armor with this quality always counts as V1 when buying and selling.
- **Easily Repairable:** Armor with this quality is easier and cheaper to repair, but more expensive to make; tests to self-repair are one step easier and professional repairs cost half as much, but the actual value of the armor increases by one.
- **Fashionable:** Armor with this quality makes relevant social tests one step easier‚Äîpeople perceive the wearer as more wealthy and high status.
- **Heavy:** Wearing any armor with this quality makes athletics-related actions and tests to resist fatigue one step harder. Each piece of armor with this quality takes up an additional encumbrance slot.
- **Light:** Each piece of armor with this quality does _not_ take up an encumbrance slot.
- **Loud:**  Wearing any armor with this quality makes stealth-related actions where being heard is a concern one step harder.
- **Dampened Hearing:** Wearing any armor with this quality makes tests to notice something audible one step harder.
- **Limited Vision:** Wearing any armor with this quality makes visual perception tests one step harder.

### Masterwork and Magic Armor

In Pentola, because magic is supersaturating the world and everything (and everyone!) in it, masterfully crafted items _are_ magical.
There is no distinction.

Particularly well-crafted items by artisans might add or remove qualities from an item, increase the AP or usage die, or provide interesting and unique abilities.
Changes to the item require a recalculation of its cost; adding a positive quality to the item or removing a negative one increases the value by 1, any added magical effects increase the value by 2 unless otherwise noted.

{{< detail example "Examples of Magic Armor" >}}
Here a few examples of magical armor created by artisans:

+ **Enamelled Vambraces of the Sphinx:** AP 1, Rating 66, Fashionable, Expensive (V14).
  These vambraces have imagery of a spinx (a mythical creature from the Aydinlar Empire) emblazoned on them in gold and brown.
  In addition to their normal qualities, these vambraces grant the wearer particular skill at solving riddles.
+ **Lion Bone Helm:** AP 1, Rating 36, Dampened Hearing, Fashionable (V6).
  This impressive helm made from the skull of a massive feline creature amplifies the wearers voice, making tests to be heard and to intimidate one step easier.
+ **Padded Thinking Cap:** AP 2, 36 (V7).
  This cap is made of woven silk and the weave itself is an homage to Archives, showing small scrolls and quills.
  It grants the wearer +9 to their Flax score while worn.
+ **Grave Greaves:** AP 1, 96, Expensive (11).
  These bronze plate greaves have been molded into the shape of catacomb walls and no amount of polishing will clear the verdigris from them.
  They make opposed power tests to resist hostile actions one step easier.
+ **Exploding Scale Hauberk:** AP 3, Rating üåë6, Heavy (V14).
  Every scale of this hauberk has been delicately inscribed with a rune of ejection.
  The wearer can will this hauberk to violently shed scales in a burst centered on them at a magnitude of 1 per usage die step they are willing to sacrifice.
  For each magnitude spent the scales deal 4 damage which may be reduced by armor.
+ **Artisanal Linen Skirt:** AP 2, Rating 66 (V8).
  The bands of this linen skirt detail an idyllic scene of peace in a spire garden.

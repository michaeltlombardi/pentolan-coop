## Axe of the Devoted

This bronze socket-axe is studded with small pearls and tiny rubies, forming an image of a heart wreathed in white flames.
When held aloft the pearls shimmer, the rubies glow with firelight, and all light nearby dims and flickers.
The haft is a dark, smooth, wood shaped like an uneven octagon and seems to have dozens of words etched into it, none by the same hand.

If you etch the name of someone you love in this haft you find that the axe moves with effortless quickness in their defense and cleaves through flesh and bone and bronze as if it were merely soft wax.
If the person whose name you etched into the axe dies, your tears will always be bloody and your hand slow, heavy.

## Moonscape Cloak

This dusty, dark blue cloak lies crumpled on the floor.
When you examine it, you see that it is embroidered with an alien version of the Pentolan skyline, spires visible, with the haunting moon watching from behind.
The moon and city alike are smeared with old blood, discolored with a dusky red.
The clasp for this cloak is brilliantly white, a perfectly shaped piece of stark white porcelain.

Whilst worn, folks always seem slow to anger, taking less offense and being generally more conciliatory.

## Quietdark Torc

This thin, perfectly cylindrical piece of black, glassy stone is strangely limp in your hand, behaving like supple silk rope.
After picking it up you find you have an overwhelming urge to place it around your shoulders and bring the ends together at the front of your throat.
If you do so, a large pearl slips out of one end and joins the two pieces together securely, as if by magnetic force.

While wearing this torc you are twice as hale and hearty as you would otherwise be.
If this torc is every removed, you are half as hale and hearty.
In either case, you only feel truly safe when beneath the always watchful moon.

## Emblazon

This trillion-shaped bronze shield has, visible beneath the dust and a thick smear of some charred liquid, a hammered and etched scene of a burning ship, the crew skeletons dancing in macabre joy whilst the flames.
At the center of this shield is a small cuprite gem in the exact same cut as the shield, the angles a perfect match.

Whilst wearing it, the bearer finds that their shield arm is light and nimble, the shield deflecting even spells with relative ease.
But whenever the bearer's blood is spilled in open air it ignites immediately, painfully, and, if not attended to, will catch inside their veins.

## Moonwatch Bowl

This clay bowl is inlaid with a mageglass moon at the center.
On the bottom is a strange, crescent-shaped rune, though Pentola’s moon is always full.

If filled with clean water it shows your reflection, but a year younger.
Drink from the bowl to reverse the effects of aging from the last year of your life.

## Thunderheart Skirt

This dark gray linen skirt is encircled by bronze charms of hearts struck by lightning bolts, a blue-gray mold clings to the folds.

If worn in the presence of a forsaken love the charms begin to glow and produce static shocks against you until you leave your former lover’s presence.

## Lavender of Lasting Life

This beautiful sketch of the life cycle of lavender is, on closer inspection, sketched with some amalgam of silver shavings and crushed amethyst.
Whenever a candle or other source of fire-light is brought near, the light flickers and dances, making it appear as if the depicted lavender is swaying in a breeze.
On the back of this thin paper are several words in a language and alphabet you do not know.

If you write the name of someone on the back of this sketch they will not age nor get sick for three years.
If you write their name twice, they will age as if five years had passed instead.

## Swan Companions

This ironoak carving of two swans embracing necks is beautifully polished, smelling faintly of cinnamon and fresh rain.
On close and careful inspection, the neck of one of the swans is slightly twisted and it's eyes betray their sightlessness.

If you speak ill of a loved one whilst carrying this statue you will find that ironoak roots have begun to grow from your tongue, binding it down to your jaw and weaving through your skull.

## Moongiven Tongue

This preserved, severed tongue is embroidered with thin silver wire shaped like the moon on the horizon and is kept inside a small wooden box.
When opened, it smells strongly of cinnamon & nutmeg---so strongly you can taste it.
The taste is more intense when someone nearby is lying.

Once per moonrise, whilst holding this severed tongue, you can command a single beast using up to five words.
Every time you use this ability sharp pain spreads through your mouth as thin silver wire slowly improves an identical image of the moon on your own tongue.

## Spearspire

This eight inch bronze long replica of the Spearspire in Pentola erupts from a rocky base and stands nearly three feet tall.
The intricate sculpting of the spire itself and the buildings at its feet are worn smoothly away, replaced with a mirror polish.

If you prick a finger or otherwise cut yourself with the top of the spire you are filled with a clear and directable rage, empowering you to do great or terrible work for the next day, though you will sleep for three after.

## Razor of Consumption

A thin, flat disc of black magelgass sits beside the tip of a neatly severed tongue.
The top of the disc is shaped to resemble a flickering flame and all firelight nearby flickers wildly in its presence.

Any injury inflicted by the bearer on another person will bring them one day closer to death.
If the bearer severs a finger, hand, ear, or other appendage of their own they stave off aging for one year per appendage removed.

## Lesson of Lucky Lightning

A enameled tablet of porcelain shows a tree struck by lightning and leaving a strange runic wound from which a river of sap flows, hardening into drops of gold.
Text in a language you do not understand seems to indicate some poem, given the repetition.

Once per week, if kept above ground, lightning will strike a random person, object, or spot within 30', causing the destroyed target to reveal treasure which may not have been there before.

## Lovers Entwined

This blue-gray marble statue is of a pair of androgynous lovers entwined, gazing deeply into one another's eyes, standing on a bronze platform.
It's scaled roughly 1:3, standing about two feet tall.
From the lovers' wrists, hips, ankles, and throats dangle tiny, delicate gold chains with intricate little iron charms attached, untouched by rust.

When displayed in a public place it slowly disintegrates lust from inside the people around it, robbing them of libido and passion.
When displayed in a dwelling it does the reverse, heightening them to the point of disregarding normal eating and daily routines until the stored energy is dissipated, at which point it's just a statue until publicly displayed again.

## Nightspire Fortress

This small, intricately detailed statue of what appears to be a seaside fortress set above sheer cliffs is made entirely of colored glass.
At the heart of the fortress is a black tower, rising above the walls and tipped with a small golden pin.
When light shines at this pin the entire statue lights up, save for the black tower which seems to grow darker.
When in the dark, a soft and wavering hum can be heard, emanating from the tower.

When a light spell is cast into this statue, gravity within a hundred feet doubles for everyone except the mage.

## Garden Greaves

These enameled linen greaves depict a thick and luscious garden of fruits and vegetables, the same scene in both sunlight and moonlight.
The sun and moon are of gold and silver filigree respectively.

When the wearer clicks these greaves together a sprawling tangle of vines sprouts, rapidly expanding to fill the room and entangle those inside.
The wearer can pass without any trouble as the vines never seem to be under their feet.

## Charred Plaque of Vengeance

A small, charred olive-wood plaque hangs crookedly on the wall, inlaid with slightly rusted iron depictions of fire consuming a man and a tower.
The man is reaching upwards as if to touch the highest parapet.
Whenever picked up with uncovered skin, a slight shock runs through your body.

If this plaque is burned entirely it will shrink everything within 120 feet to 1/100th its normal size.
Anything too small to be seen at this scale is instead turned to ash.

## Bakerslight Tablet

This clay tablet includes images of ovens and ordered lists in a tongue no one knows.
Wrapped in tattered silk patterned with faded flowers, the tablet is heavy and warm to the touch.

When there is no other light the room around this tablet is navigable as if in dim light.
In a brightly lit room it exudes enough heat to keep the area comfortably warm.

## Stonefire Drake Figurine

This figurine of a drake is carved from ironoak, polished smooth and soft - the flesh of its belly squishes slightly.

After keeping on your person for a day, it seems to come slightly alive, blinking and apparently breathing.
You can command it to attack, in which case it scrambles towards an enemy, causing stone they stand on or carry to melt.

## Stormquill

This delicate pale quill tipped in gold is, on inspection, made of very fine silver and and is not actually a feather.
The gold at the tip is inscribed with a tiny, spiky sigil.

When writing with this quill small arcs of electricity burn your message into the material, requiring no ink.
Every glyph you write is also scarred painfully into your own flesh.

## Campfire Ladle

This long handled serving spoon is made of delicate porcelain, depicting travelers huddling together around a campfire sharing a stewpot.
On the underside of the spoon is a rune whose shape your mind cannot hold, but which makes you mouth the word "yum" whenever you look at it.

When used to stir a liquid it heats it to the optimal eating temperature, hot enough to warm you but not hot enough to burn you.
If it is every broken, a burst of magma sprays from the image of the stewpot.

## Winterdrake Tunic

This lavender tunic stops just below the knee, no matter the height of the wearer.
Into it are sewn thousands of small porcelain scales, overlapping and threaded through with a silver wire.
The scales are always cool to the touch and are decorated with tiny enameled snowflakes.
A few scales are missing, seemingly broken in the past.

This scale armor keeps the wearer comfortably warm no matter the weather.
The scales break easily when hit, but immediately send deeply freezing temperatures into whatever broke them, frosting them over immediately.

## Sewtight Needle

This sharp needle is made of solid silver, unnervingly sharp.
It is marred only by a single, perfect fingerprint of blood by the eye.

Whenever you sew with this needle the stitches are eternally perfect, exactly right, and will never come apart unless magically destroyed.
However, every stitch you sew is also sewn into your own body, tightening your flesh and shrinking you slowly inside your own skin, tighter and tighter.

## Ironmind

This near-perfect representation of a human brain is made entirely of iron, polished so smoothly by an unknown force such that it feels soft, almost pliant.

The bearer may touch someone to grant them voluntary immunity to mind-altering magics and heightened intellect and awareness.
This protection lasts for 1d8 hours, during which time the bearer is unconscious.
This permanently weakens the bearer's mind and smooths the brain further.

## Blackwind Tablet

This small wax tablet is inscribed with a series of dots and dashes, a code unknown to any living scholar.
The edges are decorated in miniscule detail with a laborer accomplishing dozens of tasks, trailing lines made of slivers of smoothed obsidian that make you think of extreme speed.

You may prise a sliver (5d6 remain in the tablet) loose and insert it into your flesh.
For the next 10m your speed is doubled, though you are thoroughly exhausted after and trail tendrils of black smoke while effected.
The sliver can never be extracted, burrowing deeper every time you try.

## Tephratic Shield

This wicker shield is deeply black, its face is visibly the darkest thing in even lightless rooms.
Marring that field of dark is a perfect representation of the watchful moon, embossed in tarnished silver.
Grabbing it by the handle always results in a sharp, surprising jolt.
If a magical item comes in contact with this shield it is rapidly drained of energy towards uselessness and then disintegration.Other magics which encounter this shield appear to be hungrily devoured by it, the shield eating into whatever source that magic came from.

## Recitation of Diminishing

The script on this lambskin scroll flows and undulates before your eyes, the ink made of iron shavings seemingly alive, sparking with tiny twinkles.
Every time you touch it a jolt runs through you and you hear alien words whisper in your ear.

Every time you recite the words the scroll whispers to you, two things happen: everyone within earshot except for you withers, losing 2d6 pounds of muscle, and a word from the scroll burns away in an arc of tiny lightning.
3d6 words remain.

## Field of Moonless Flowers

This many-colored marble bas-relief of a field of blossoming flowers is remarkable primarily for the depicted moonless night sky, made entirely from black, thousand-faceted mageglass, and for the faint smell of cinnamon wafting from the pink flowers.

If mounted to a wall which sees sunlight, all plants within a hundred feet grow as if in perfect lighting conditions, even if they're kept entirely hidden.
If, however, any of those plants fall under moonlight they wither and die.

## Selfish Chrysanthemum

This beautiful porcelain centrepiece resembles a riotous Chrysanthemum flower, the enamel unfaded and the petals thin and curling upwards, the color of the sky as the sun breaks over the waters.
When near open flames the light dims as if afraid to burn beside the centrepiece.

When gazing at this centrepiece for too long you feel compelled to lean in and smell it; if you do so, you find that afterwards the whole world is dark, colorless, motionless, and for the next 1d4 minutes you have eyes only for this beautiful flower.

## Stormguardian Tower

This small model of a guard tower is made from rough granite.
Atop the tower is a minuscule, working replica of a ballista made from tiny boards of ironoak, denser and harder than metal, with a sliver of gold in the shape of a lightning bolt loaded, ready to fire.

When the bearer of this guard tower sees someone in imminent danger and wants to protect them the bearer and target switch places, the bearer arriving in an explosive blast of lightning.

## Halfmoon's Judgement

This headscarf is expertly woven to resemble the colors of a sky during sunsets.
However, something stark and jarring waits upon it, a half-moon, the shadowed half made of delicately sewn-on mageglass.
The edge of the scarf is lined with more than a thousand tiny halfmoon iron charms.

If an iron charm is removed from this headscarve and ends up in the body of anyone but the wearer it will begin to calcify their flesh, slowly turning them into a granite replica of themself in 1d4 days.

## Bracelet of Rising Fortune

This delicate silver bracelet is connected by thin chains to silver rings which only and always fit over the index and ring finger of someone who closes the clasp of the bracelet around their own wrist.
Bracelet and rings are lined with incredibly tiny scrolling opaline images depicting a pair of laughing figures more and more finely dressed and happy in each image.
Where the chains meet on the back of the hand is a trillion-cut tourmaline set into silver, anchored to a chain at each point.

If someone kisses the tourmaline when the wearer's hand is presented, the kisser finds that for one day and a night they are sweeter of tongue and sharper of mind when it comes to business, but only so long as they retain good nature towards the bearer.
If they ever become upset with the bearer, the effect is negated.

## Hostright Tablet

This small, black, translucent stone tablet is carved and inlaid with untarnishing silver, depicting a hearth and a feast with dozens of smiling participants.
On closer inspection, everyone but the figure at the center is crying.
their smile strained.
Whenever light shines upon this tablet, it seems to be drunk into the hearth at the bottom, dimming the source of light slightly.

If this tablet is displayed in a room where three or more folk gather, the person who called the gathering finds that their words are twice as persuasive as before and their desires are often met.
If the host fails to provide food and water for their guests, they instead find their own tongue useless or worse, unable to articulate their desires effectively.

## Merchant Lord's Helm

This open-faced helm is made wholly of gold, intricate opaline inlays depicting a wealthy noble and his guards brandishing their weapons.
It has a crest of pale pink feathers, thick and soft.

When worn into battle the wearer finds that they move more slowly, their awareness dimmed by thoughts of mercantile business ideas.
Whenever their adrenaline spikes their lips turn a pale blue as they freeze up.

## Autumnal Shade

This bronze-and-glass statue of a young child playing beneath an apple tree feels wrong, somehow.
On closer inspection, the leaves are made of mageglass, razor sharp, and the boys face is strangely haggard, wizened.

If you insert one of the tiny razor leafs into another person, for so long as that leaf is in their body they will age a year for each hour that passes.

## Icemoon Anklet

This twining silver bangle has a half-moon charm made from blackened iron and hums quietly in the dark.

When worn at night no cold reaches you, though you feel like you are being watched by something deep and old.

## Archer’s Repose

This delicate blown-glass panel depicts a porcelain archer, eerily beautiful, drawing an arrow.
When light catches the archer’s eyes, it seems to flicker.

If you stare into the Archer’s eyes for more than a few moments you find yourself falling deeply in love with them, your feelings for others waning over the next week.

## Heart’s Desire Locket

This small bronze necklace features an anatomically accurate platinum heart which, when opened, contains a strange rune inlaid with gold.

While wearing it you can hear the thoughts of those around you, so long as they are about someone they love.

## Kindleheart Shield

This round bronze shield has an ironoak boss carved in the image of a flickering flame.
Whenever it is out of direct light, careful listeners can hear the faintest echo of a defiant chant.

When held aloft in firelight, the shield's boss writhes vigorously, pulling the nearby flames into the hearts of nearby allies, wreathing them in flames which only burn those who wish them harm.

## Shadowless Bow Drill

This small firestarting tool is made of ironoak and includes a thin leather thong tooled with the names of flame in a hundred tongues.
It never casts a shadow.

When used to light a fire, the flames have no heat but emit a light ten times brighter than otherwise expected, but burn twice as fast.

## Floating Gazebo

This miniature rendition of a marble domed gazebo has veins of silver and platinum shooting through the stone.
When not held it floats serenely a yard off the surface it is placed on, bobbing into place.

While held or carried, the bearer finds that theri leaps and steps carry them into the air, sailing with ease.
If upside down, the effect is reversed.

## Firebright Eye

This smooth orb is fashioned from Pentolan marble and carefully painted with a vibrant purple eye, though the pupil is a small rune instead of a black dot.

If pressed slowly against one's own eye socket it will melt away the person's eye slowly, replacing it.
From that point on the bearer can see throough any fires they have started, so long as they continue to burn.

## Noseloop of Scents Now Heard

This small black glass nose ring, when worn through the septum, enables the wearer to smell everything they hear as its own distinct scent.
When all is silent, the wearer smells only cinnamon.

## Turncoat Buckler 

This small pitch-painted shield is dotted with tiny eleven-pointed iron stars and a boss painted in the guise of the watchful moon.

When held aloft and reflecting moonlight, anyone that light touches finds their heart stirred to terrible depths of greed, covering everything they see and disregarding all prior allegiances while the buckler is visible.

## Wrath of the Drake

Dangling from a silver chain, this pendant is carved from Pentolan marble in the likeness of the serrated claw of a fighting Drake;
regardless of size, the chain always seems just long enough to dangle the pendant over the wearer's heart, settling there with a slight jolt each time.

If the wearer pierces the flesh of their chest with the pendant they find themselves filled with wroth and power, making tests to destroy and overcome one step easier, though it sinks into the wearer's flesh slowly and will pierce their heart after ten minutes, turning them into a mindless drake.

## The Laughing Lady

This small pewter figurine of a triumphant woman atop a mound of jewelry and scrolls has upraised arms and laughing eyes.
On close inspection, the blood smudged around the base may be wiped away to reveal that the jewelry and scrolls are miniature but actual works of art themselves, like a shrunken hoard of gold and silver and vellum.

Whosoever carries this figurine may place it upon a scrolla nd piece of valuable jewelry before bed. When they awaken, they find they have mastered the dweomer on the scroll, though both scroll and item are now incorporated into her base.

## Cloak of the Lazulian Tide

This bright aquamarine cloak is immaculate and undulating, like waves on tropical beaches.
The clasp is made of deep dark sapphire, wondrously worked and free of any other material.
When fastened, it jolts the wearer with a slight shock.

When wet with seawater, the cloak fans out from the wearer in seven crashing waves, crushing and pushing away everything close.

## Heart-Hearth Cup

This otherwise plain clay cup is made extraordinary for the veins of iron running through it, seemingly used to hold it back together after it had been broken several times.
Inside the cup, pale red mold seems to cling to the iron and neither grows nor can be scrubbed away.

When wine is drunk from the cup the liquid is warm and filling, regardless of original temperature, and fills the drinker's heart with fire.
Until the alcohol leaves their system they are unreasonably passionate, following it wither it wills.

## Sunreap Sickle

This strange farm tool has a handle of porcelain instead of wood, delicately decorated with sunlight dappling a field of flax.

When wielded in twilight, the blade can harvest sunlight, deepening the shadows and saving the light in its decor to be released later with a drop of blood.

## Lastlight

This small, forward curving dagger has a simple olive handle, polished smooth and soft and a bronze blade chased with silver whirls evocative of soulflame.

When used to take a life, the wielder sees the victims final memories, a fast tour through their life.
If used to draw their own blood, the wielder can instead peruse the memories of any life the blade has taken, peering only as deep as the wound.

## Rosethorn Cap

This soft cap is embroidered with a pale rose with bronze-threaded thorns.
Though well worn, it smells of cinnamon instead of sweat.

While worn, the wearer can appear to be any age they choose.
If worn for more than an hour, the worn age becomes permanent, though only in appearance.

## Redwave Pocket Knife

This flipknife is gaudy, the orange scales embossed with images of roiling flames, the blade itself made of obsidian.
On the inside edge, a bloody smudge.
When the blade is placed into a flame it conntects the holder to all flames, enabling them to see from any flame they know is burning.

## Tablet of Striking

This chalk tablet appears to be set into the fitting of an old mirror, the edges in worked sterling silver chasing whorls and shells.

While carried, the bearer hears any word written on the tablet as the distant crashing of waves.

## Red Moon Risen

This mosaic depicts the night sky with twinkling stars of pale marble and an oddly ominous moon in a pale red marble all set into a background of jet.

Anyone who touches this mosaic while thinking of someone who wronged them finds a growing heat rising in their chest, swiftly becoming uncomfortable.
If they persevere in touching the moon, it blisters their fingers but they find at a later date the target of their ire has suffered from a surprise fire in their life.

## Basil Basin

This simple wooden bowl is filled with pleasant smelling water, the dark wood edges carved in the likeness of wrapping basil.

Any food eaten after rinsing ones hands in the basins is excruciatingly flavorful, every last subtlety coming to the fore in ways entirely unpredictable.

## Moon Kitten Bracelet

This thin silver bracelet is worked at the clasp in the shape of a small kitten batting at a full moon made of porcelain.

While worn, the wearer has an urge to lick their hand;
any time they do, they hear a distant meow as friendly cats in the area converge towards them.

## Willowgrove Tapestry

This beautifully woven woolen tapestry depicts a thicket of willow trees over a lazy river;
on inspection, the wood in the trees is actually thin wood instead of wool.

Anyone who spends a few minutes in the room with this tapestry finds that their very bones become more flexible , moving under pressure like wands of willow before the wind.

## Vinestone Greaves

Carved from the green-blue Pentolan marble, this pair of greaves are fastened with vibrant vermillion silk ribbons.
Their elegant beauty is somewhat marred by the strange vines which have miraculously grown through them, cracking them somewhat.

When clicked together, the vines writhe and extend, planting themselves into any nearby surface and quickly spreading across it, growing through everything with wanton hunger for space.

## Handbell of the Artisan

This small bronze bell peals with a joyous ring, echoing in the bellies of anyone nearby.
The work is exquisite, the olive handle practically glowing, every surface utter perfection and pleasing simply to gaze upon.

Whosoever rings the bell is able to see the vibrations it causes, drawing their eyes to any imperfections in nearby works, though it does not provide them the expertise to understand them, only to notice.

## The Happy Elephant

This miniature porcelain figurine of a baby elephant, trunk waving wildly while splashing in the mud, is notable for the vibrant hues---vivid violet skin, emerald eyes, ochre mud---and for making non-celestial light dance with joy whenever it is held up.

So long as this fragile figurine is kept safe and carried, the carrier finds that their rest is easy, their health robust, and age comes slowly.
If the figurine is ever broken, they find instead that their heart fills with misery, their flesh sloughs, and their bones weaken daily.

## Lastkiss Blade

This slender dagger is made wholly of smooth black mage glass, double edged and needle-pointed.
An octagonal hilt, a strange rune etched deeply.
Merely looking at the rune fills one's mind with thoughts of the person they love most, causing them to picker their lips slightly.

If a wielder kisses the rune before spilling lifeblood with this blade, they add a year to their beloved's life, though they shorten their own by the same.

## Osteoflame

This small brazier is made of ironoak with a marble basin, the wood and marble alike carved in the images of hungreds of young creatures cavorting under a sunny sky.
The foot of the brazier, however, resembles piles of old broken bones woven together to hold up the world the animals dance upon.

Any fire that burns in this brazier, regardless of fuel, will immolate any body part placed over it in mere seconds, reducing the flesh to nothing and leaving behind only blackened bone which functions as if the tendons and muscles yet remained.
That body part is immune to any further damage for thirteen years, after which it crumbles to ash.

## Battledrake, Snarling & Proud

This illustration of a muscular and armored battledrake is etched into a yard of scraped and ancient magenta drakeleather.
Sumptuously, the etching has been carefully filled with finely ground mageglass, sparkling dark, every minuscule grain sharp.

Slicing one's own hand against the depicted drake's mouth brings it to life, wriggling off the leather to grow and grumble.
If the battledrake is not satisfied with the amound of blood spilled, it will stare at the bearer until one of them blinks.
If the bearer blinks first, the drake will devour them.
Otherwise, the drake will need feeding, and soon.

## Shadowheart Shield

This simple wicker shield is made from blackened willow, edged and bossed with oiled bronze.
Careful inspection reveals tiny runes of unknown provenance, the reading of which makes one shiver til they close their eyes.

When carried in shadows, this shield causes the bearer to blend in with them so long as they are confident.
If even the slightest shred of doubt creeps over them, the shield's effect is inverted, highlighitng them for anyone to see.

## Carbuncle's brandishing

This bronze sigil is formed in the shape of a burning mountain a thumb's width across.
In the center of the sigil, the red carnelian eye of a carbuncle, polished and smooth.

If heated and pressed into one's own flesh, the mark enables the bearer to turn their own skin into flecible granite, their eyes to carnelian.
If either of their eyes is pried loose in this state, they cannot return to flesh and blood.

## Cuirass of Plenty and power

This sumptuously engraved gold-plated armor is held together with silver silk ribbons and depicts a woman on a dais, hands outstretched, with hundreds of supplicants kneeling and offering a hoard of treasures, each glowing softly.

While worn, all magic effects targeting the wearer are amplified threefold.
IF the cuirass is removed, the former wearer finds themselves cut off from the power of the armor unless they sacrifice some precious item to it, pressing the item into the metal, causing the depiction to adjust accordingly.

## Foreborne Ribbon

This long indigo silk ribbon is stitched through with delicate silver wire, the name of every person who ever wore the ribbon.
With each new wearer, the ribbon lengthens to accommodate the new name, always written in the same flowing script.

WHile worn, the wearer is gifted with the support of those former wearers, if the memory of them approves of the wearer.
They can whisper encouragement or distract, though many stay silent.
The longer the ribbon is worn, the more and older the memories that take notice.

## Shardcrushers

This pair of periwinkle blue drakeleather boots has extravagant iron hobnails, polished and oiled.

When in the presence of demons, the wearer is incredibly light on their feet when moving but immovable when still.
If the hobnails come in contact with the flesh of a demon they exert sudden and violently powerful force.

## Ironeye

The chartreuse drakeleather of this worn out eye patch has absorbed years of sweat, oil, adn not a little blood, darkening it.
The patch itself is stiffened by a thin sheet of iron polished into a smooth mirror, facing inward.

While worn, the wearer feels somewhat more fragile, prone to injury and fatigue.
Anyone wearing the patch over a socket from which they cannot normally see, however, can also see particularly strong magic (such as that suffusing demons) as clouds of glowing dust.

## Split Tongue of Imprisoning Knowledge

When exercised, your forked tongue writhes and anyone nearby who fails a resistance test against you is unable to speak any secret you both know.

## Stinging Sweat of Imprisoning Muscle

When exercised, the sweat pouring off your body stings you but falls like acid to any other surface. When it touches the muscle of another creature it causes the fibers to fill with lactic acid and cramp painfully for the duration.

## Ringing Sweat of Emboldening Knowledge

When exercised, each drop of sweat from your brow falls with the sound of a distant chime. For the duration, tests to inquire after or absorb information are one step easier.

## Ringing Voice of Hindering Intent

When exercised, your voice becomes sonorous and everyone nearby is compelled to be still and listen to you, unless they win a resistance test against you. For the duration, they cannot take any action to contradict you if they fail.

## Resonant Blood of Opening Fungi

When exercised, any of your own blood that you spill onto a surface falls with the sound of softly tolling bells and causes crimson fungi to sprout wherever it lands, devouring the surface material and eroding a hole.

## Twisted Teeth of Diminishing Flesh

When exercised, your teeth wrench in your mouth, forming small fractal spires. For the duration, your teeth rend flesh as easily as soggy paper, tearing great hunks of it away with each bite.

## Scaled Skin of Sealing Mouths

When exercised, your skin seems to shimmer as the soft scales in your flesh harden. Similar scales grow quickly across the face of your target if they fail a resistance test, sealing their breathing orifices shut with plagued flesh.

## Polished Palm of Piercing Plants

When exercised, the skin of you hand becomes smooth & fixed like a marble relief, taking on the image of a rosebush in bloom. Your target must make a resistance test to prevent their body hair thickening into the stems of a rapidly growing rosebush.

## Gnarled Skull of Spawning Plants

When exercised, your skull's shape twists and contorts as if thorny vines are squeezing it, and flora sprouts from any nearby soil, swathing the area with tendril-like vines that reach for everyone but you, seeking to hold them still.

## Spiked Nail of Attracting Portals

When exercised, your sharp fingernail elongates and points unerringly at the nearest doorway or passageway to your current goal, even if it is hidden. This effect lasts for ten minutes per magnitude you exercise it at.

## Thick Tongue of Revealing Muscle

When exercised, your tongue swells uncomfortably in your mouth, but so do your muscles under your skin. For the duration, all physical tests are one step easier, but you must hold your breath or spend an action to breathe laboriously.

## Shimmering Echo of Compelling Metal

When exercised, the words you speak echo repeatedly, even if whispered, and leave sparks floating lazily nearby. You can use those echoes to command bronze items near you, forming commands up to Magnitude words long, including naming the items.

## Smooth Breath of Emboldening Metal

When exercised, your breathing becomes a smooth, meditative whoosh, and any metal you carry seems to breathe with you, flaws fleeing the item with every breath. You automatically repair any metal items you are carrying by one step.

## Twisted Tears of Withering Fear

When exercised, tears spiral from the corners of your eyes, falling away from your face but not down. If one of these tears touches the flesh of another creature, warmth and calm come over them, fortifying them against their terrors.

## Spiked Tongue of Avenging Memory

When exercised, the taste buds on your tongue rise to form numerous tiny spikes. If they pierce your flesh, you may recall a painful memory and use any skill or ability you observed in it for the duration.

## Ringing Blush of Piercing Bone

When exercised, blood floods your cheeks, and you hear the rumbling of a gong in your ears. For the duration, bone parts beneath your hands as easily as wet clay.

## Scaled Hair of Energizing Brine

When exercised, your hair shimmers as tiny copper scales sheathe every strand. The body of water nearest to you becomes charged with an energy you can draw on, summoning to yourself a bolt of lightning that dissipates in your hair.

## Burning Scent of Consuming Plants

When exercised, the air around you is filled with the smell of a forest fire, and all nearby flora begins to wither and smolder as if under an oppressive heat, turning to ash slowly and without flame.

## Repulsive Phlegm of Energizing Chaos

When exercised, your phlegm comes alive with horrific intent. When it lands on a creature, that creature reacts unpredictably to any and all stimuli for the duration, provided it fails a resistance test against you.

## Metallic Nail of Attracting Violence

When you exercise this knack, the bronze nail of your right thumb gains a thin layer of verdigris, and anyone nearby who fails a resistance test against you finds themselves violently angry with you and only you, lashing out.

## Jeweled Skin of Spawning Plants

When exercised, the veins of your skin darken as your flesh turns to jade. From those veins erupt flowering vines that writhe and burrow into any nearby surface, planting delicate orchids whose pollinia are tiny pieces of jade.

## Ringing Blood of Energizing Fear

When exercised, the blood that falls from your wounds lands with the sound of a tolling bell & sends shivers through the hearts of those nearby. On a failed opposed power test, they flee in terror. They fail automatically if they draw your blood.

## Burned Palm of Diminishing Intent

When exercised, the scar on your hand comes painfully fresh, flames erupting from it anew. Those who behold the flames feel their will sapped away. If they fail a resistance test, all actions for the duration are one step harder.

## Shimmering Scent of Attracting Brine

When exercised, the air around you shimmers as if in a burst of sea spray, and the nearest body of water surges toward you in a rushing wave, ten cubic feet per magnitude in volume.

## Fearsome Reflection of Spawning Metal

When exercised, your reflection becomes a terrifying alternate you, grinning wide-eyed and moving uncannily. Your reflection may make any metal object in its sight-line suddenly grow wicked spikes, like a discharged grenade.

## Shimmering Voice of Duplicating Flesh

When exercised, your voice takes on a haunting dreamlike quality. You may whisper to a creature and cause it to manifest an additional limb per magnitude for the duration. Afterward, the limb(s) slough(s) off into swiftly dispersing glitter.

## Burned Skin of Piercing Portals

When exercised, your flesh cracks and warps, and the smell of stale ash fills the air. For the duration, you pass through any walls or doors as if merely walking through smoke.

## Jeweled Eye of Hindering Fear

When exercised, the blue of your eye deepens as the orb transforms into a sapphire, glowing from within. Anyone the light of your eye touches is inured against fear. All tests against it are one step easier for the duration.

## Ringing Voice of Withering Belief

When exercised, the syllables of words you speak chime through the minds of those who listen, fracturing surety and making them question everything.

## Ringing Scent of Attracting Stone

When exercised, the molten smell of old bell-works suffuses your surroundings. With a thought, you can cause loose stone to speed toward you, prying away from wall, masonry, or floor, up to ten stone in weight per magnitude.

## Gnarled Nail of Duplicating Mouths

When exercised, your fingernail twists and discolors to a deep plum. Any surface you scratch with the nail splits into a mouth, teeth & tongue forming from available material. The more crooked the scratch, the sharper the teeth & more ravenous the mouth.

## Ringing Sweat of Emboldening Metal

When exercised, droplets of your sweat fall. Metal struck will toll with the sound of mourning bells. That metal glows softly, erasing all flaws. For the duration, treat any metal items as if undamaged.

## Fearsome Movement of Excruciating Muscle

When exercised, you move with an uncanny grace, fluid and inhuman. While your battle dance continues, onlookers who fail a resistance test find themselves trying to keep up, lactic acid building rapidly in their bodies, fiery cramps tormenting their musculature.

## Burning Presence of Animating Knowledge

When exercised, ethereal lavender flames cloak you and half-opaque fuchsia smoke roils out on exhalation. You may direct the flames and smoke to form a threedimensional representation of a memory or idea, though only in low-fidelity.

## Jeweled Skin of Concealing Intent

When exercised, a pale iridescent tint rapidly spreads over your skin, deepening as your flesh transforms into pliant opal, forming a living statue. For the duration, you are inscrutable, still and blank except when in intentional motion.

## Gnarled Lips of Duplicating Knowledge

When exercised, your lips split and writhe as you speak, but you are able to perfectly impart experiences you've had to those who listen, granting them knowledge of the events as if they had been there as you.

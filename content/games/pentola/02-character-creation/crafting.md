In Pentola there is an approach to magic that seeks to uncover the rules which govern the universe.
The application of these rules to manipulate reality is known as the _Craft_, and those who do so are known as **Crafters**.
Well-known applications are called dweomers and can be learned from others and from writings.

The Craft is not a secret or hidden knowledge—but, much like advanced fields of scientific inquiry in our world, few invest much of their time and energy into it—for the vast majority of people it is enough to know a few convenient dweomers and the basics, to use items and to pay for specialists when more is required.

## Common Dweomers

Almost all children in Pentola learn two dweomers as a matter of course.

They learn the dweomer for _auratic vision_ because they live in a heavily magic-using society—and therefore find it important to be able to investigate effects and persons for safety reasons, if nothing else.

They also learn the dweomer for _message_ as a way to communicate in the city; after all, with limited literacy and freely available magic, sending messages is a cheap, useful way to keep in contact.

|     Dweomer    |    Traits     | Description |
|:--------------:|:-------------:|:------------|
| Auratic Vision | Concentration | See magic auras as smoky hazes of color and intensity—the stronger the magic, the thicket the haze.
| Message        | Resist        | Send a mental message up to 5 words per magnitude long which the target can decline or accept, which manifests as a warm itchiness in the target's ear.

These two dweomers may be automatically applied at magnitude 1 as a ritual without any test and are memorized with a rating of 30.

Your character also starts with one or more [routine dweomers](/03-the-craft/dweomers/list/#routine-dweomers) memorized;
roll on that table to determine which dweomers you start with or pick from the table freely.

For more information on dweomers and the Craft, see [Chapter III: The Craft](/03-the-craft).

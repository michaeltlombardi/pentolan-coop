Once you have rolled for your starting characteristics you can determine your attributes.
These are pools of points which represent your ability to sustain damage (in the case of Blood) and use magic or special abilities (in the case of Tephra).

+ **Blood:** Add the significant digits of your character's {{< icon bone >}} and {{< icon iron>}}â€”the result is their Blood.
  In Pentola, citizens refer to how thick or thin someone's blood is as a metaphor for how tough they are, or how much danger seems to affect them.
  People who are _thick-blooded_ stride through dangers recklessly, coming out relatively unscathed, and survive injuries you would expect to be lethal.
  When someone's luck seems to be running out in a fight, Pentolans will oft remark on their _thinning_ blood.
  Throughout these rules and in supporting documents you may see it written with the following glyph: {{< icon blood >}}
+ **Tephra:** Add the significant digits of your character's {{< icon flax >}} and {{< icon iron>}}â€”the result is their Tephra.
  Pentolans describe people as being _hot_ with Tephra if they are intrinsically powerful or adept at magic, believing them to be literally full of the magic they associate with the warmth of the volcanic chambers beneath the city.
  If someone's Tephra is _cooled_, Pentolans believe they are not capable of much more magic... at least, not without thinning their blood dangerously.
  Throughout these rules and in supporting documents you may see it written with the following glyph: {{< icon tephra >}}

{{< detail note "Dozenal math!!" >}}
This is the first and only time during character creation you'll need to do math!
Luckily, at this stage, you're only adding single digits together that can't go high enough to roll over ðŸŒ‘ and make you do anything unfamiliar.

Since you're _only_ adding the **significant numeral** for each characteristic, you'll be adding 2 + 3, 2 + 4, or 3 + 4--all of which come out to exactly the numbers you expect (5, 6, and 7 respectively).

{{< detail example "Determining Attributes for Taryn" >}}
Having rolled the characteristics for Taryn we can calculate their attributes:

{{< icon blood >}} With {{< icon bone >}}<strong>4</strong>9 and {{< icon iron >}} <strong>2</strong>9, Taryn's Blood is <strong>6</strong>.<br />
{{< icon tephra >}} With {{< icon flax >}} <strong>3</strong>9 and {{< icon iron >}} <strong>2</strong>9, Taryn's Tephra is <strong>5</strong>.

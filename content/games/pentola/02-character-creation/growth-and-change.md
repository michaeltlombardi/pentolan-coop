Characters in Pentola advance in a few ways:

1. By fulfilling short term ambitions, characters may improve their characteristics.
1. By fulfilling long term ambitions, characters may unlock new knacks.
1. By using their skills, characters have a chance to improve those skills.
1. By acting in the world, characters may improve or lose their reputations.
1. By interacting with the people and groups with whom they have relationships, those relationships grow stronger or weaker and new ones may form.
1. By spending downtime characters may improve any of their ratings or gain new ones.

## Fulfilling Ambitions

Whenever a short term ambition is achieved, note which characteristic played the most vital role in achieving it and roll a dz%, comparing the result to the characteristicâ€™s current rating:

- if the result is over the current rating, it improves by 2
- if the result is equal to the current rating, it improves by 6
- if the result is under the current rating, it improves by 1

## Improving Skills Through Use

Once per adventure when a character makes a normal or harder test and uses a relevant skill bonus, make a mark beside that skill.
At the end of each adventure, roll a dz% for each skill you marked during play.

+ If the result of the roll is higher than the skill's rating, you have improved itâ€”in this case, increase the rating by 4.
+ If the result is lower, the character has not learned enough to improve.

**Every time** you botch a test using a skill, add 6 to the skill bonus.
This represent a character gleaning new understanding from failure.

Skills can never have a rating higher than ðŸŒ‘ðŸŒ‘.

{{< detail example "Improving Skills" >}}
After their first adventure, Taryn has successfully used the following skills: leadership, first-aid, scrounging, and wrestling.
The player rolls dz% for each skill:

+ Taryn rolled a 55 against Leadership (59), and improves it by 4 to 61.
+ Taryn rolled a 82 against First Aid (20) and improves it to 24.
+ Taryn rolled a 42 against Scrounging (45) and does not improve it.
+ Taryn rolled a 40 against Wrestling (30) and improves it to 34.

## Gaining and Losing Reputation

Every time a character takes an action which is witnessed and could reinforce a character's reputation, make a mark to the right of the reputation on your character sheet.

Every time a character takes an action which is witnessed and could degrade a character's reputation, make a mark to the left of the reputation on your character sheet.

After each adventure, note the total marks against each of the character's reputationsâ€”one mark which reinforces it cancels out one which degrades it.
Roll a dz% for each remaining mark.

If the mark is to the right of the reputation and the result is higher than the reputation bonus, increase it by 4.
If the mark is to the left of the reputation and the result is lower than the reputation bonus, decrease it by 4.

{{< detail mechanical "Reputations Over Time" >}}
This system is intended to reduce the amount you need to roll during an adventure for your reputations, but you could, optionally, just roll every time a reinforcing or degrading action is taken.
Alternatively, you could just shift the reputation bonus by 4 with each action and skip rolling altogether.

## Changing Relationships

Every time a character fulfills an obligation or grants a favor to an ally, dependent or organization, thwarts an enemy or is thwarted by them, make a mark to the right of the relationship on your character sheet.

Every time a character fails an ally, dependent, or organization, or ignores an enemy threat, make a mark to the left of the relationship on your character sheet.

After each adventure, note the total marks against each of the character's relationshipsâ€”one mark which reinforces it cancels out one which degrades it.
Roll a dz% for each remaining mark.

If the mark is to the right of the relationship and the result is higher than the relationship bonus, increase it by 4.
If the mark is to the left of the relationship and the result is lower than the relationship bonus, decrease it by 4.

{{< detail mechanical "Relationships Over Time" >}}
As with reputations, you may want to roll as soon as the action happens or just automatically modify the relationship without a roll.

## Spending Downtime

During downtime between adventures the players may improve their characters.
For every three month period of dedicated practice or research a character may choose one from the following list:

- Modify the rating a skill, reputation, relationship, vocation, or memorized dweomer by 6
- Increase the rating of your {{< icon iron >}}, {{< icon flax >}}, or {{< icon bone >}} by 3 to a maximum of 90
- Acquire or improve a knack by one magnitude
- Acquire or improve a miracle by one magnitude
- Make an investment in your wealth, spending cards from your resource deck to give you a chance to go up a wealth level; the total value of the spent cards indicates your chances on a dz%, though the check and result are not made until the end of the next downtime

{{< detail mechanical "Rate of Change" >}}
Players can expect a steady trickle of improvement during play, especially if they're working towards their ambitions or leaning into their relationships, but advancement is still relatively slow and flat.

You can speed up the rate at which characters acquire improvement points by letting them choose more than one benefit from their downtime.

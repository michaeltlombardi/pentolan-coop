When you begin play, choose an _ally_, a _dependent_, and either an _enemy_ or an _organization_.
You have a relationship rating with each of these equal to 36.

+ **Ally**. This is an entity a player character can ask for aid, can call in favors from, or with whom they otherwise have a positive relationship.
+ **Dependent**. This is usually a member of the character's family or an entity that relies upon them.
+ **Enemy**. This is a sworn enemy--a rival from your youth, someone you crossed, someone you embarassed, or possibly an entity who finds your very existance offensive.
  Interactions with this entity are _usually_ negative, but may occasionally just be at cross-purposes.
+ **Organization**. This could be a Crafters' sorority, a former regiment, or possibly a cult.
  The character has an association with this organization; they typically deal with this group on a favorable basis.
  Work with the referee to determine the scope of the organization, which could be as great as a whole nation, or just a small wandering band of seafaring poets.

{{< detail mechanical "Relationships and Hooks" >}}
Relationships are intended to provide the referee—and the players—with hooks and handholds by which to attach characters to the city.
An ally should provide information or jobs, a dependent should get into trouble frequently, an enemy should try to inconvenience or harm the character and thwart their ambitions, and organizations should actively generate problems and opportunities alike.

A relationship test may be called for whenever you try to lean on the relationship in the fiction or take advantage of the relationship's advantages.

On a triumph for a relationship test, also automatically increase your relationship rating's significant digit by one (ie a 44 becomes a 54).
On a botch also decrease your relationship rating's significant digit by one;
after a botch, you cannot lean on that relationship for the rest of the adventure.

New relationships may arise from play—in these cases, they start with a rating of 6.

| Relationship     | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|:----------------:|:-----------|:--------------|
| **Ally**         | Loan an appropriate item, service, or finances; assist on social test; provide info and/or employment | Allies demand favors of you in the form of money, errands, etc for each favor given; enemies of your ally become your enemies
| **Dependent**    | Count your relationship rating as relevant to any test where you support, aid or defend a dependent | Dependents regularly get themselves and the character into trouble; Enemies will target dependents to harm the character
| **Enemy**        | Count your relationship rating as relevant to any test where you attempt to thwart your enemy; gain employment by enemy's opponents | Enemies will try to harm characters as often as possible; All social interactions (parleys, influence, negotiation) with an enemy will be at one step harder than normal
| **Organization** | Access organizational facilities and services; gain information and possible employment; optionally supplicate yourself | Organizations typically demand a charge for their services, either in cash or a favor; Enemies of an organization may harry and harm the character for their relationship to the organization

{{< detail example "Relationships in Play" >}}
At the start of play, Taryn selects Rose Carozza, their aunt and a Warden, as an ally.
Taryn takes Chonk, an injured old Great Pangolin, as their dependent.
Finally, as Taryn's goal is to become a full fledged member of the Wardens, Taryn takes them as an organizational relationship.

During Taryn's first session it becomes clear that lacking a proper weapon (Taryn only has a single dagger which doubles as their utility knife) is a problem.
Taryn asks their aunt, Rose, for a loaner weapon and makes a relationship test.
Taryn's Iron is 29, so their relationship rating of 36 is higher and can be used for the base goal for this test.

Taryn rolls a 32 and the referee declares that Aunt Rose lends an old shortsword and a spare longbow to Taryn—on the condition that Taryn must succeed in the trials to join the Wardens or return the weapons upon failure.

Later in the adventure, Taryn is ambushed in an alley by Anan Moonblade, who has been paid by the father of a man Rose killed in a judicial duel—Taryn has inherited their aunt's enemies.

{{< detail mechanical "Starting Relationship Details" >}}
It can be a bit daunting to spin out several detailed relationships all at once.
One useful way to handle this is to collaboratively add details to the relationships in play—that is, when you think your ally would first be useful to your character or the game generally, invoke them and flesh them out on the fly with your referee.
The referee, in turn, is encouraged to think of times when your relationships would drive interesting choices for your character, be helpful in moving things forward, or throw problems into the fiction for you and the other players to handle.

In either case, don't feel like you need to have several pages of relationship context built up to use a relationship;
sometimes it's enough to know that your dependent is your nephew and spin things out from there.
Of course, it's okay to take some time to flesh those relationships out, too!
Just make sure that the player and referee are on the same page so things can adjudicate smoothly.

## Allies

Roll on the table below to randomly determine your ally's vocation or select one from the larger [Vocations](../vocations) table.

<!-- TODO: Add how you met, why you're friends, and their personality or something -->

{{< rolltable "pentola/relationships/ally" "" "singular" >}}

## Dependents

Roll on the table below to randomly determine who your dependent is to you or choose another sort of relationship that makes sense for your character.

<!-- TODO: Add why they need you, what trouble they attract, and their personality or something -->

{{< rolltable "pentola/relationships/dependent" "" "singular" >}}

## Enemy

Roll on the table below to determine your enemy if they're an individual.
Note that an organization can also be your enemy, in which case see [Organization](#organization) below.

<!-- TODO: Add how you met, why you're enemies, and their personality or something -->

{{< rolltable "pentola/relationships/enemy" "" "singular" >}}

## Organization

To randomly generate an organization, roll dz to determine the type of organization, then roll on the related table to determine details about it.
Use those details as the skeleton of ideas to flesh out a group of people in the world—Pentola is enormous and varied, far too large and fractured to detail every organization you might encounter.

{{< rolltable "pentola/relationships/organizational/type" "" "singular" >}}

### Academic Organizations

Roll a dz 6 times or, for fast generation, roll a dz and read straight across.

+ **Type:** The institution of the organization that defines its structure
+ **Focus:** The purpose of the organization, what it primarily spends its effort on
+ **Symbol:** The marking used to differentiate this organization from others
+ **Color:** The primary color associated with the organization, often used in their clothes or banners
+ **Reputation:** The strongest belief outsiders have about the organization's behaviors and beliefs
+ **Distinctive Feature:** In Pentola the beliefs and repeated behaviors of people change their bodies—members of organizations tend to acquire one or more distinctive features over time.

{{< rolltable "pentola/relationships/organizational/academic" >}}

{{< detail example "Example Academic Organization" >}}
We first roll a dz 6 times to determine which details will define this organization:

+ **Type:** 8, Institute
+ **Focus:** 9, History
+ **Symbol:** 1, Drake
+ **Color:** 6, Orange
+ **Reputation:** 8, Pious
+ **Distinctive Feature:** 🌑, Voice always echoes

**Guardians of the True Word**

A snarling bronze drake is embossed upon the doors to this old and prestigious research guild.
The academics within practice psychohistorical magics and divination to discern the Truth of the World as it has been—they then share this interpretation with each other orally, crafting poems as records in a tongue taught only to full members of the guild.
They are funded by students of the True Word but do not evangelize to others—they seek only to understand and share with those who share their passion.

Artists of the Word stay with the Guardians for weeks at a time, learning the new discoveries and committing them to memory, that they may go out into the world and create works which echo this truth.

The Truth is never spoken aloud to outsiders, but no word spoken by a believer is ever heard only once—every syllable seems to echo in the air, no matter how hushed the tone.

### Religious Organizations

Roll a dz 6 times or, for fast generation, roll a dz and read straight across.

+ **Symbol:** The marking used to differentiate this organization from others
+ **Preferred Sacrifice:** The sacrifice that is considered most valuable to this organization
+ **Official Attire:** Ranking members of religious organizations are often visible by a special item of clothing

+ **Distinctive Feature:** ☀️️️️️, Ears are huge

**The Troutslappers of Her Aquatic Majesty**

The adherents of Nianzhen, the Mermaid Queen, are a terrifying force in the canals and spires of Pentola.
These devout souls carry their holy symbol, a two foot long solid bronze trout, as a weapon and a warning.
They stalk the city in deep red robes and seek out those who would break Nianzhen's commandments—which change daily depending on the inquisitor.

They practice their faith by routinely drowning and reviving each other in an attempt to get closer to Her Aquatic Majesty and understand her mysteries more completely.
Their only unwavering belief is that art, especially statues, are an affront to Her—after all, water is formless.

Even when out of their vestments these pious interlocutors are visible by their massive ears—all the better to hear blasphemy on the lips of citizens...

**Conjuration of the Peaceful Waves**

This group of sailors specialize in the Craft as applied to sailing, and moreover, into melding art with seamanship.
Wherever Conjurers of the Peaceful Waves are found, so too are fantastic ropes, sails, anchors, lanterns, and all sorts of other equipment.
The Conjurers lose their left pinky as they advance in the organization, the digit turning a brilliant blue and slowly disintegrating as they improve their skills.

The Conjuration gathers in beautifully crafted halls across Pentola and even has a few halls in other lands and cities—anywhere the seas need crossing.
They are serious competitors for any and all other groups and guilds who make goods for seafaring.

**Skylion Spire**

Exploding up from an isle in the Pentolan Bay is the Skylion Spire, a sheer megalith of a perfect cylinder.
Far above, beyond the sight of those in the canals there is a feature atop the spire through which the high winds sometimes pour, causing echoing reverberations which sound like ten thousand lions roaring over the city.

The Skylions who live in the spire and recruit for it are amongst the most dangerous militants in the city, mostly made up of warriors who are both champions, able to channel miracles, and battlecrafters able to weave the dweomers into combat and stack the odds in their favor.

Their crest, a bloody Griffin's head, is emblazoned on their banners and tunics.
The skylions are renowned across the city for being deadly duelists and interveners, often useful as proxies for a duel in a court of swords or as mercenaries when up against unbelievable odds.
The skylions seek glory and recognition every day, aiming always to be known as the greatest masters of violence and battle.

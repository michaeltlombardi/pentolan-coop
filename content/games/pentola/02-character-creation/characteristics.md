Characters in Pentola have three characteristics: Iron, Flax, Bone.

+ **Iron:** In Pentola, iron is both rare and precious as it has apparent metamagical and demon-abjuring properties; any magic effects are more portant when iron is incorporated in the application and demons of all sorts shy away from iron as it ignores their abilities and defenses.
  Iron represent's a character's force of will, presence, and metaphysical aptitude.
  When someone is _heavy_ with iron, they're powerful personally and magically, a noticeable presence in any room.
  If they're _light_ on iron, they may slip by unnoticed or unremarked.
  Throughout these rules and in supporting documents you may see it written with the following glyph: {{< icon iron >}}
+ **Flax:** is a crop which represents so much of human ingenuity‚Äîone of the earliest and most widespread crops domesticated, flax supplies the Pentolans with food, oil, cloth, paper, and paint; it represents ingenuity, industry, trade, craft, and knowledge to the Pentolans.
  Flax represents a character's mental prowess and training, including their knowledge and intuition.
  When someone is _stuffed_ with flax, they're knowledgeable and well trained, able to apply their knowledge in all sorts of situations.
  If they're _meager_ with flax, they lack training and education and have to rely on their more limited direct experience and first-hand knowledge to see them through.
  Throughout these rules and in supporting documents you may see it written with the following glyph: {{< icon flax >}}
+ **Bone:** Pentolans are not strangers to danger or hard work and associate bone with both, priding themselves on their physical daring and the use of their bodies to accomplish their tasks, though they are ever mindful of their own ultimate fragility.
  Bone represents a character's physical prowess and training, including their strength, agility, hand-eye coordination, etc.
  When someone's _strong-boned_, they are fast, powerful, flitting from danger to danger with ease and grace.
  When they're _brittle-boned_, they are unable to overcome strenuous physical obstacles, having to rely on their other resources to get things done.
  Throughout these rules and in supporting documents you may see it written with the following glyph: {{< icon bone >}}

Characteristics are the base goal for tests.

Declare _what_ you're trying to accomplish (your intent) **and** _how_ you intend to accomplish it (your approach).
The referee will determine if your action requires a test and which characteristic is most appropriate.

Then you'll try to roll under the appropriate goal.
Your characteristics determine your base chance of success at any given test, but you'll _usually_ be able to add a bonus from a relevant skill, vocation, or ability.

You determine your starting characteristics by rolling **one dz**, which gives you your starting characteristic array.

| Result | Starting Characteristics |
|:------:|:------------------------:|
| 1      | {{< icon iron >}} 20 {{< icon flax >}} 30 {{< icon bone >}} 40

| 8      | {{< icon iron >}} 46 {{< icon flax >}} 26 {{< icon bone >}} 36
| 9      | {{< icon iron >}} 36 {{< icon flax >}} 46 {{< icon bone >}} 26
| ‚òÄÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è     | {{< icon iron >}} 29 {{< icon flax >}} 39 {{< icon bone >}} 49
| üåë     | {{< icon iron >}} 49 {{< icon flax >}} 29 {{< icon bone >}} 39
| 0      | {{< icon iron >}} 39 {{< icon flax >}} 49 {{< icon bone >}} 29

A **36** in a characteristic is the average for a person--higher scores are above average--and a **90** is the absolute upper bound of anyone not affected by special abilities or conditions.

{{< detail mechanical "On Starting Characteristics" >}}
At first glance, this table seems like it might be a bit unfair, giving better rolls significantly better starting characteristics.
If you wanted to approximate more of a bell curve, you could roll 6d12 for each stat and add that together in dozenal... but that would be painfully bad math to try to do at the table.

Besides that, the bell curve would mostly give you results from about 18 to 50 in dozenal--notably having a lower and upper bounds below this result set.

Pentola leans somewhat more into the underdog upstart tropes as written.
To give players a more heroic start you could increase their distribution above by a dozen, giving a spread of 30-59 instead of 20-49.

{{< detail example "Determining Characteristics for Taryn Carozza" >}}
To determine Taryn's characteristics, we roll a dz and get a ‚òÄÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è:

{{< icon iron 1.5em 1.5em >}} <strong>29</strong> <br />
{{< icon flax 1.5em 1.5em >}} <strong>39</strong> <br />
{{< icon bone 1.5em 1.5em >}} <strong>49</strong>

At the beginning of play Taryn has a bit less personal power than most people, has an average education and knowledge-base, and is stronger, tougher, and more agile than most people.

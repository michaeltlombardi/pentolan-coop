Distinctions are things which ground characters a little more fully in the world or provide a jumping point for you to build from.
They break down into personalities, physical features, interests, fears.

The following table give you a bit of background you can use to make your character more memorable and which you can build on to have a starting point.
As with all of the other character creation tables, you are _not obligated_ to use them!
You can roll on them, choose from them, make up distinctions of your own, or otherwise start play with something more of a blank slate.

{{< rolltable "pentola/distinctions" "Roll dz% for each distinction or roll once & read straight across." >}}

G> #### Example: Determining quirks and Ambitions for Taryn
G>
G> For Taryn we roll once for each column in the traits table:
G>
G> - **Personality:** Contradictory (21)
G> - **Physical quirk:** Narrow Eyes (56)
G> - **Interest:** Learning (58)
G> - **Fear:** Drakes (33)
G> - **Long Term Ambition:** Ward Off Demonic Threat Through Song (90)
G>
G> These traits paint an image of Taryn as a person eager to learn and always watchful, seeking truth by speaking up even when it's unwise.
G> Their fear of Drakes makes their start as a would-be Knight more difficult _and_ interesting.
G> The ambition to ward off Demons with a song implies that they have a curiosity about the _Gondolieri_ who are famous for abjuring the demons in the canals with their songs. -->

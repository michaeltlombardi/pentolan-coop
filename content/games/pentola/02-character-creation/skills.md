Skills are things a character specializes in doing.
In cases where a character has both a vocation _and/or_ one or more skills which could apply to action, use whichever rating is higher.
After a character successfully passes a normal or harder test against a skill, place a mark to the right of the skill.
During the next down time between adventures, roll a dz% for each skill with such a mark; if the result is greater than your current skill bonus, increase your bonus by 4.
In either case, erase the mark.

{{< detail example "Increasing Skills Through Use" >}}
The rule as written allows characters to increase their skills through use, though slowly.
It's also designed to prvent spamming the same skill over and over as a solution to all problems as you mark it only once per adventure.

Use isn't the only way to improve your character's skills but it's the only way to do so without spending downtime.

In Pentola there is no defined skill list, but here are a few examples for inspiration:

> Dodge, Archery, Fencing, Culture (Gascon), Alchemy, Athletics, Driving, Bluffing, Persuasion, Rhetoric, Mechanisms, Streetwise, Trade, Literacy (Pentolan), Occult Lore, Medicine, Wrestling, Painting, Swimming, Thaumaturgy, Drakeback Riding, Herbalism, Mathematics, Goldsmithing, Scultping, Researching, Stealth, Haggling, Literacy (Aydinlar), etc.

Characters begin play with the skill ratings below; write in whatever skills you like for each rating:

- 2 skills at 56
- 1 skill at 40
- 6 skills at 26

In addition, _every_ character gets +10 to their Crafting rating;
if you did not select Crafting as a skill, you have it anyway.
Crafting is not (necessarily) about making items;
it's knowledge of [_The Craft_](/03-the-craft), which is what Pentolans call the study and practice of magic.
Everyone in Pentola has some functional familiarity with magic.

{{< detail example "Skills and Vocations in Action" >}}
Tick-Tock Tarasi ({{< icon iron >}}36 {{< icon flax >}}46 {{< icon bone >}}26 ) has _Clockmaker_ as a vocation (rating 30), as well as the skills Crafting (66), Literacy [Pentolan] (56), Researching (40), Alchemy (26), Engineering (26), Demonology (26), Dodge (26), Wingsuiting (26) and Appraisal (26).

**Scenario 1:** Shooting a Crossbow

None of Tarasi's skills or her vocation apply to this action, so she needs to roll under her relevant characteristic; in this case, {{< icon bone >}}, on a dz%.
She can only succeed on a roll under 26.

**Scenario 2:** Picking a Lock

In this case, Tarasi has no skills that apply to this action, but her vocation arguably does—so she can add count it towards this test.
The referee calls for a {{< icon flax >}} test, so Tarasi has a goal of 46.
Because of her vocation, however, she will _also_ succeed on any roll ending in 0, 1, or 2 (except for a 00 which is always a botch)!
She can also critically succeed on a 01 or 02.

**Scenario 3:** Appraising a Lock

In this case, both Tarasi's vocation _and_ her skill Appraisal apply to this action.
Her vocation has a higher rating (30 vs 26), so she would use her vocation on this test.
The referee calls for a {{< icon flax >}} test, so Tarasi has a goal of 46.
Because of her vocation, however, she will _also_ succeed on any roll ending in 0, 1, or 2 (except for a 00 which is always a botch)!
She can also critically succeed on a 01 or 02.

**Scenario 4:** Appraising Art

In this case, only Tarasi's Appraisal skill applies to this action.
The referee calls for a {{< icon flax >}} test, so Tarasi has a goal of 46.
Because of her skill, however, she will _also_ succeed on any roll ending in 0 or 1 (except for a 00 which is always a botch)!
She can also critically succeed on a 01.

## Archetype Skills

If you're unsure of what sort of character you'd like to play mechanically, you may choose to roll for an archetype on the table below or select one freely.

{{< rolltable "pentola/archetype/skills" >}}

{{< detail mechanical "Skills and Ambiguity" >}}
Note that some of the skills overlap or seem a bit random—it is intended that you pick skills that you want your character to specialize in, then use those specializations to solve problems.
The list is freeform so you can capture _exactly_ what makes your character yours.

You can determine if a skill is too broad mostly by judgement:
Fighting is probably not specific enough, but a particular fighting style is okay.
Influence is too broad, but bluff, rhetoric, pursuasion, and bluster are all okay.
Largely, if there's a more specific word that can speak to a character's _approach_, rather than their _intent_, it's an indicator that the more specific word should be used.
Sometimes, this isn't possible.

You can also swing the other way and go for more vague skills that apply more broadly, but be aware that characters will likely accrue a short list of skills with high bonuses.

{{< detail mechanical "Passively Using Skills" >}}
Sometimes you'll want to represent that a character is knowledgeable rather than skilled in a particular action.
This does _not_ imply that there are no actions to test for with a given skill!
Knowledge of medicine might help you set a bone or identify an illness or determine someone's overall hardiness.
Similarly, expertise in wrestling will convey knowledge about things outside of being able to grapple—they'll pick up kinesiology, reading people, etc.
Reward characters for specializing!

If a character's skill ranking is comprehensive, consider that they automatically know anything an apprentice in that field might know.
For everything else, make them test.

If a character's skill ranking is extraordinary, consider that they automatically know anything a seasoned professional in that field might know.
For everything else, make them test.

If a character's skill ranking is incredible or unbelievable, consider that they automatically know anything about their field that isn't hidden, unique, or otherwise very hard to discover.
For everything else, make them test.

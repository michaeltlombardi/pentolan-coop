Reputations are statements or adjectives about characters that other people _may_ believe.
For example, a character might have a reputation for being unlucky, or frightful, or earnest, or for being a priest-killer, or for being timid, or any number of other possibilities.

Reputations function as a special type of skill and have a rating.
Whenever you are interacting with someone who might know the character’s reputation, and in the first situation where that reputation might matter, make an Iron test where the only relevant rating is that reputation.

If successful, the person the character is interacting with believes in the character’s reputation.
If unsuccessful, the person does not believe in the reputation.
In either case, do not test for that reputation again with this person unless the reputation bonus changes.

In general, reputations can make social tests either one step easier or more difficult, depending on the reputation and the context.
In some cases, a reputation may even make a test unnecessary.

Characters begin play with two reputations, either from the table below or of your choice, both starting at 30.

Every time a character performs an action where the action can be observed or recorded _and_ the action could either _reinforce_ or _disabuse_ observers of the reputation, place a mark to the right (if the action could reinforce the reputation) or the left (if the action could disabuse observers of the reputation).
At the completion of an adventure or when beginning an interlude—whenever there’s a sensible break in the adventure to reflect and take time to recover—you should roll dz% for each mark beside your reputations.

For each mark to the left of the reputation, roll dz%.
If the result of the roll is lower than the reputation, decrease the reputation by 4.

For each mark to the right of the reputation, roll dz%.
If the result of the roll is higher than the reputation, increase the reputation by 4.

Characters can also attain new reputations in play--usually they will start with a rating of 6 but the event may be widely enough observed or impactful enough to cause it to start higher.
Characters can have any number of different reputations.

A reputation is a statement about what people _think_ of the character, not **necessarily** about how the character conceives of themselves.
Sometimes a character will want to build a reputation that doesn't match their behavior—perhaps they pay for songs to be written about them, or rumors, or they make public performances—and sometimes a character will have a reputation they _don't_ want.

Reputations are also a feedback mechanism for character behavior—the choices the characters make have an impact on how the world perceives them.
It's particularly useful to have NPCs in the world recognize the characters by reputation or to remark / key in on them—in this way, reputations are also a tool for referees to use to figure out how an NPC might behave towards characters.

Whenever characters do anything particularly notable it's a good idea to grant them a new reputation to account for it.

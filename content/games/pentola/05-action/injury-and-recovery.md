When a character takes damage that their armor or other effects can't soak, they lose {{< icon blood >}}.
When a character reaches 0 {{< icon blood >}}, all additional damage inflicts major wounds.

<!-- TODO: Add an option for not-dying at 0 and one less brutal? -->

## Major Wounds

If a character loses at least half their _current_ {{< icon blood >}} from a single instantaneous source they suffer a major wound per the table below, using the SN of the attack's result to determine the hit location if it wasn't specified.
The wounds are separated by the type of attack that inflicts them.

Some results on the table include a value in parentheses, like `(9+)`.
After a character suffers a major wound they roll a dz; if the result is greater than or equal to the number listed, the character dies from their wound.
Otherwise, they'll survive, provided they get competent medical attention quickly.

Any effects that say "until healed" end when the character returns to their maximum {{< icon blood >}}.

If the result on the table is something that could be on either side of the body, it is on the left if the attack result was even and on the right side if it was odd.

## Medical attention

Anyone can try to provide medical attention to an injured character by making a hard {{< icon flax >}} test for each wound sustained.
For each success, the injured character recovers 1{{< icon blood >}}, up to their maximum {{< icon blood >}}.

If the test is a failure, no {{< icon blood >}} is restored and the character may not try to heal that wound again until they improve a medical skill or vocation.

## Natural Healing

For every week of relative rest a character regains 1{{< icon blood >}}.

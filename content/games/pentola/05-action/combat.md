When things go absolutely sideways, combat often results.
The combat rules build on top of the core rules, particularly [action time](../01-core-mechanics/time).
Remember that combat is just one formalized type of action - the same flow is used for chases, escapes, etc.

Combat, like all action, passes in _moments_ and uses DUAD initiative with every participant getting an action and a reaction for each moment.

In addition to the nearly infinite options for what a character can do, some specific combat actions and reactions are codified below.
These are _not_ a finite list of actions, just those which probably need fairly consistent rulings across tables.

## Actions

### Attacking

An attacking character makes a {{< icon bone >}} test, using any relevant ratings as normal.
If the target doesn't use a reaction against the attack and the test result is a success, the character inflicts the singles die of their result in damage against the target.
This damage is reduced by any armor the target is wearing.

Alternatively, an attack can be used to reposition, disarm, or grapple an opponent or otherwise impose your will on them.

Finally, an attack may be made at a specific bodypart (for example, aiming at an unarmored limb) but the test to do so is one step harder.

### Moving

Moving somewhere _close_ can be done freely without spending an action each moment.
To move somewhere _nearby_, a character must spend their action doing so.
To move somewhere _distant_, they must spend both their action and reaction.

## Reactions

### Blocking

A character may choose to position your shield in front of an incoming attack by making an easy opposed Bone test; if successful, reduce the usage die of the shield by one step.

### Dodging

A character may choose to try to move out of the way of an incoming attack or effect by making a hard opposed {{< icon bone >}} test.

### Parrying

A character may choose to bat aside an incoming attack with their own weapon by making an opposed Bone test.

## Action Economy

Instead of performing the default "one action, one reaction" each moment, characters may instead choose to:

+ Forego their action for an additional reaction or vice versa
+ Forego their action to make their reaction test one step easier or vice versa
+ Take an extra action or reaction, making every test that moment one step harder for each additional action or reaction

This choice can be made each round when the character is declaring their turn in the initiative.

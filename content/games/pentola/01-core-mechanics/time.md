While playing it's sometimes useful to break time down mechanically—during fights or tense moments, for example.
Largely though, play passes at whatever speed makes sense for the adventure and action—minutes may pass, or hours, or weeks.

When you need to mechanize time for an action scene, it breaks down like this:

- Action occurs every _moment_, which is roughly three seconds.
  In a moment, a character can make one action and reaction without penalty.
  If a character wants to perform two actions they may forego their reaction and vice versa.
  A character may take an additional action or reaction without forgoing another, but all of their tests are one step harder as a result.
  A character may also forego an action or reaction to focus on just the one thing, making the test one step easier.
- Actions include, but are not limited to, the following:
  - Exercising a knack
  - Making an attack
  - Moving
  - Applying a dweomer
  - Channeling a miracle
  - Throwing a grappling hook
  - Drinking a potion
  - Using a matrix or scroll
  - Shoving someone over a parapet
  - Setting fire to thatch
  - Scaling a wall
- Reactions include, but are not limited to, the following:
  - Parrying
  - Blocking
  - Dodging
  - Interfering with another action

## Initiative

In addition to time breaking down into moments you need to be able to determine what order actions and reactions happen.
In Pentola we use the _declare up, adjudicate down_ (**DUAD**) system for initiative.

Each character involved in the conflict first rolls against their intellect, adding a skill or vocational bonus if appropriate.
The initiative test is treated like a multiple-participant opposed test.

The participant whose result is _worst_ declare their actions and reactions first.
The participant whose result is _next worst_ declares their actions and reactions next, and so on until the participant with the best result declares their action and any reaction.

Then, in reverse order, the actions take effect—so the character who declared last acts first and the character who declared first acts last.

Note that initiative doesn't always mean combat—you might break into initiative when chasing someone, or racing to an objective, or trying to provide a distraction, etc.

{{< detail example "Initiative with Two Combatants" >}}
Toph and Tarasi are sparring.
Toph has an Flax of 39 and a fencing skill bonus of 43.
Tarasi has an Flax of 30 and a gearslinger skill bonus of 20.

At the beginning of the moment both characters roll an initiative test and their results are compared:

Tarasi rolls a 79, failing her test, and Toph rolls a 31, succeeding.

Tarasi therefore declares her action first: she decides to kick at Toph.
Toph declares next; since he knows Tarasi will kick at him, he declares he will use his reaction to dodge her kick and his action to elbow her in response.

Toph is able to try to elbow Tarasi first.
He succeeds on his test, inflicting damage.
Tarasi attempts to kick Toph and succeeds on her test with a 21, but Toph also succeeds on his dodge (27) and his result is higher—therefore she does no damage.

The next moment starts and they both roll for initiative again and repeat the cycle.

{{< detail example "Initiative with Three Combatants" >}}
As in the last example, but there's now a third combatant, Galner (Flax 30, Needlejutsu 21), who is teamed up with Tarasi (Flax 30, Gearslinger 20) against Toph (Flax 39, Fencing 43).
Toph's result is a 31 (success), Tarasi's a 79 (failure), and Galner's a 10 (success).

Tarasi declares her action first, deciding to kick at Toph.
Galner succeeded on his test but his result is lower than Toph's, so he declares next: he will tackle Toph.
Toph declares last and this time decides to focus on Galner, dodging his tackle and elbowing him.

Toph acts first, successfully elbowing Galner.
Galner acts next, succeeding on his test to tackle Toph (rolling a 15), but Toph critically succeeds on his test (rolling a 2) and so avoids him.
Tarasi acts next, succeeding on her test to kick Toph and inflicts damage.

At the beginning of the next round they all test initiative again and repeat the cycle.

{{< detail mechanical "A Note on DUAD">}}
The initiative mechanic is one which is harder and longer to explain than it is to use.
In practice, it does a few things:

- It keeps combat dynamic, ensuring each round the initiative order will likely change.
- It rewards players for paying attention to what everyone in the combat is doing—you can only react to actions lower in the initiative order, or play off other actions.
- It ratchets up tension—the unpredictability and potential for dangerous combinations of actions make for more lethal combat.

It has a higher cognitive load on the referee and players than traditional or side-based initiative, but in practice it's manageable for fewer than a dozen combatants—which is where traditional initiative systems break down too.

My method for tracking it is to record the results for each participant on a piece of paper or in a text document, putting lower results lower on the page than higher ones.
I then mark each result with an **S** for success (if the participant succeeded on their roll), a **CS** for critical success, or an **F** for a failure.
I then work my way up the document, starting with the lowest failure to the highest.
Repeat for the successes and then the critical successes.
I then flip the order and the actions are adjudicated as normal.

If this is too complicated or fiddly for your table, pretty much any other initiative system can work here.
I do encourage you to try it though, first!

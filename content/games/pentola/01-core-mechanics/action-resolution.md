In Pentola ambiguous actions are resolved by following the **Intent-Approach-Adjudicate** workflow:

## Intent

The player declares what their character is trying to accomplish—what outcome they want from the action or scene.

{{< detail example "Declaring Intent" >}}
Chris is playing as Giuseppe "Porkslope" Esposito, a guerilla art-mage who uses his skill and magic boots to lay traps.
Porkslope needs to get up on the side of a spire in order to design his next graffiti-spell, but a guard thinks he is suspicious.

Chris says that he wants to convince the guard that he is actually here to _clean_ the spire's walls.

At this point, Chris has declared Porkslope's intent.

## Approach

Once the intent is known, the player must explain their approach—how the character will attempt to realize their intent through action.

{{< detail example "Explaining Approach" >}}
Chris is playing as Giuseppe "Porkslope" Esposito, a guerilla art-mage who uses his skill and magic boots to lay traps.
Porkslope needs to get up on the side of a spire in order to design his next graffiti-spell, but a guard thinks he is suspicious.

Chris previously declared that Porkslope intends to convince the guard that he is actually here to clean the spire's walls.

The referee asks Chris to explain how Porkslope will do this and Chris responds by saying Porkslope will hold up his bucket and a dirty rag, point to his own poor clothes, and try to play it off like he's some contract-cleaner.

Other approaches Chris could've tried to fulfill Porkslope's intent:

- Having Porkslope explain in great and boring detail the series of events that led to the spire needing to be cleaned, his guild being hired, and him being assigned this dangerous work.
- Having Porkslope play it off as a dead-eyed service worker who just _really_ wants to get this over with.
- Having Porkslope try to hand off his bucket and tools and get the guard to try to go out the window to clean the tower herself.
- Innumerable other options constrained only by Chris's ability to think up new approaches.

## Adjudicate

Once the intent and approach are known the referee is then—and only then—able to begin to adjudicate the action.

First, the referee will decide if a test of some sort is neccessary.
A test is necessary only under the following conditions:

1. The action as defined by the intent and approach together can fail.
   - If the combination of intent and approach can't reasonably fail—for example, reaching the second level of a tree house by climbing the ladder—there's _no_ reason to call for a test.
2. The action as defined by the intent and approach together can succeed.
   - If the combination of intent and approach can't reasonably succeed—for example, reaching the second level of a tree house by digging at the base of the tree—there's _no_ reason to call for a test.
3. The action as defined by the intent and approach can succeed, could fail, and failure has meaningful consequences.
   - If the consequences of failure are that the character must try again and again until success, those are not meaningful consequences.
    Note that the same intent and approach may have meaningful consequences under one set of conditions but not under another.

{{< detail example "Adjudicating Actions" >}}
Chris is playing as Giuseppe "Porkslope" Esposito, a guerilla art-mage who uses his skill and magic boots to lay traps.
Porkslope needs to get up on the side of a spire in order to design his next graffiti-spell, but a guard thinks he is suspicious.

Chris previously declared that Porkslope intends to convince the guard that he is actually here to clean the spire's walls by holding up his bucket and a dirty rag, pointing to his own poor clothes, and trying to play it off like he's some contract-cleaner.

Depending on the referee and the game, here are a few ways this could go:

- The referee decides that the guard knows the spire is due for a cleaning and that Porkslope's explanation seems to fit right in.
  There is no reasonable chance of failure, so the referee announces that the guard lets Porkslope pass.
- The referee decides that the guard has already worked with the spire-cleaners' guild before and knows their customs and attire—and Porkslope matches neither.
  There is no reasonable chance of success, so the referee announces that the guard is going to try to detain Porkslope for further questioning.
- The referee decides that the guard's neither particularly knowledgeable nor lax in her duties, so Porkslope can try to convince her and this will require a test.
  Note that in this example Porkslope could succeed, in which case he can continue, or could fail, in which case the guard's suspicions will be aroused.
  Porkslope can't just try again over and over, there are meaningful consequences for each failure.

## Tests

When a referee calls for a test, they'll tell you which characteristic is most appropriate given your intent and approach;
this is your base goal, you want to roll under your characteristic on a dz%.

{{< detail example "Actions and Tests: Locked Door" >}}
Cerise, a strong and experienced mercenary, is attempting to get past a locked door by kicking it down in several scenarios:

1. Cerise reaches an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town to look for clues but the side door is locked.
   Even though it is possible that Cerise's first attempt to break down the door might fail in this scenario the referee decides there are no meaningful consequences to that failure, nor to retrying until she _does_ kick the door down.
   The referee declares that Cerise successfully kicks the door in.
2. Cerise is chasing a fleeing bandit who has slipped into the building and barred the door behind him to buy himself more time to escape.
   In this scenario not only can Cerise fail to kick in the door but each failed attempt gives the fleeing bandit more time to escape.
   The referee decides that a test is required and directs Cerise to test against her Bone characteristic.
3. Cerise is locked into a steel vault and needs to escape.
   In this scenario failure to kick open the door means that Cerise remains locked in the vault.
   However, the referee notes that the vault door is nearly a foot thick and that Cerise's stated approach—kicking down the door—is simply impossible.
   The referee declares that Cerise kicks the steel door but fails to open it.

The referee will also determine, based on your intent and approach, whether a test is **easy** or **hard**.
Abilities, items, and other effects may shift the difficulty of a test by one or more steps;
from easy to normal, normal to hard, or vice versa.

For an easy test, you may swap the numerals of your result to whichever outcome is better for you.
For a hard test, if the numerals of your result _can_ be swapped to a less advantageous outcome, they must be.

{{< detail example "Tests: Easy and Hard" >}}
Caleb is attempting to convince the guard to share some gossip using several different approaches:

1. Caleb wants to share false gossip about the topic to prompt the guard to share his own knowledge.
   The referee decides that this approach _could_ work, but isn't particularly more or less likely to do so.
   The referee therefore calls for an Flax test to pull off the minor deception.
2. Caleb wants to approach the guard with a smoke and a friendly smile before mentioning the topic of gossip off-handedly.
   The referee knows that the guard is young and slightly ill disciplined —and decides that the guard is particularly susceptible to this method.
   The referee therefore calls for an easy Flax test, allowing Caleb to read the results whichever way is most advantageous, potentially turning a failure into a success.
3. Caleb wants to intimidate the guard into sharing the gossip by being physical and not-quite threatening him.
   The referee knows that the guard is young, slightly ill disciplined, and has a lot to prove—and therefore determine that this method is particularly unlikely to get the fulfill the desired intent.
   The referee therefor calls for Caleb to make a hard Flax test, forcing Caleb to take the worst version of his results, possibly causing him to fail when he might otherwise succeed.

If you have a relevant skill, vocation, reputation, or other bonus, choose the highest one.
If that bonus is _higher_ than your attribute, it forms the base for your goal instead.

Regardless, you will always succeed on a test if the second numeral of your roll is less than the first numeral of your bonus, known as the **significant numeral** of your bonus--so with a bonus of `45`, any roll ending in `0`, `1`, `2`, or `3` would be a success.
If the first numeral of your roll is `0` and the roll would be a success by this criteria, it is instead a **triumph**, the best possible interpretation of your intent as fulfulled by your approach.

Any roll of `00` is a **botch**, the worst possible outcome for your intent as determined by your approach.

{{< detail mechanical "Avoiding Math" >}}
Instead of having you add your highest relevant bonus to your base characteristic, these rules ensure a character with a relevant bonus always has a better chance at success than someone who doesn't--they can succeed on rolls above their characteristic, even if their skill isn't very high.

This is meant to keep your characteristics as a baseline of competency but make having a specific bonus the most sure way of succeeding at a thing--raw talent and ability are nice, but training and experience will usually win out.

The inversion of numerals for easy and hard tests also prevents needing to reroll while bumping the odds noticeably.

This also keeps to the system's promise not to make you do any math on the fly!

{{< detail example "Showing the Numbers">}}
Prior examples explained how to adjudicate a test, but not what the rolling looks like in detail.

For a character with a characteristic of 35 and a skill of 2☀️️️️️️️️️ a result of:

- 01 is a triumph (the first numeral is 0 and the second is under the significant numeral of their bonus)
- 00 is a botch
- 34 is a success (second numeral is under the significant numeral of their bonus)
- 44 is a failure
- 43 can be inverted to 34 if the test is easy (therefore succeeding), but must stay a 43 if it is hard (take the worse outcome, in this case failure).
- 1🌑 could be inverted to 🌑1 if the test is easy (succeeding as 1 is less than the significant numeral of their bonus)

If their skill was 5☀️️️️️️️️️ then they would use that as their base goal instead of their characteristic--always use the higher of the two values!

## Opposed Tests

Opposed tests are made by both sides who are in direct competition with each other.
Both characters make the tests as normal and the results depend on how well both sides do:

- **One Side Succeeds:**
  If one side succeeds their test and the others fail then the successful side has won the opposed test.
- **Two or More Sides Succeed:**
  If two or more sides succeed then whoever rolled the highest in their test wins the opposed test.
  However, if one side rolls a triumph while the other rolls an ordinary success then the side that rolled the triumph wins.
- **All Sides Fail:**
  Whoever rolled the highest without botching in their test wins the opposed test.
  In the case of ties for both the player wins.
  If the action is player-against-player, the defender wins.

{{< detail example "Opposed Tests: Vying for Crowd Favor" >}}
Caleb and Cerivny are vying for the favor of the crowd during a debate.
Cerivny relies on her natural charm (30) and skill at persuasion (45) to sway the crowd.
Caleb draws on their deep experience (40) and leverages the crowd's emotions through recalling their historic heroines and bringing to mind their greatest triumphs and struggles (25), making their test easy.

Here are a few ways this could play out, depending on the results of each characters' test:

1. Cerivny rolls an 87, failing, and Caleb rolls an 83, which he can turn into a 38, thereby succeeding.
   Caleb wins over the crowd.
2. Cerivny rolls a 63, succeeding, and Caleb rolls a 32, succeeding.
   Because both characters succeeded at their test and Cerivny's roll was higher, Cerivny wins over the crowd.
   Even if Caleb inverted his result to a 23, it would still be lower than Cerivny's 63.
3. Cerivny rolls a 41, succeeding, and Caleb rolls a 01, critically succeeding.
   Even though both character succeeded Caleb had a critical success and therefore wins over the crowd.
4. Cerivny rolls a 91, failing, and Caleb rolls a 100, botching.
   Even though both characters failed, Caleb actually botched and therefore Cerivny wins over the crowd.

Distances in Pentola are abstracted to a few ranges:

- Things and people are _close_ if you can reach out and touch them with no more than a few steps.
- Things and people are _near_ if you can walk to them within a few seconds—within about 30 ft / 10 meters.
- Things and people are _distant_ if they're further than nearby but still clearly perceptible—within about 150 ft / 50 meters.
- Things and people are _far_ if they're further than distant but you can still visible.

Characters can move somewhere near as an action in a moment.
If they forego their reaction, they can instead sprint to somewhere distant.

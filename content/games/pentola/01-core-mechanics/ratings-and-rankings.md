Bonuses to tests in Pentola come from several sources -- vocations, skills, relationships, and reputations.
The level of bonus a character has in each of these is the _rating_ of that vocation, skills, relationship, or reputation.

Reaching certain ratings in these bonuses unlocks a ranking, a general category for how profound that bonus is:

- A rating between 01-1🌑 is _nominal_ (**N**)
- A rating between 20-3🌑 is _basic_ (**B**)
- A rating of 40-5🌑 is _comprehensive_ (**C**)
- A rating of 60-7🌑 is _extraordinary_ (**E**)
- A rating of 80-9🌑 is _incredible_ (**I**)
- A rating of ☀️️️️️️️️️0-🌑🌑 is _unbelievable_ (**U**)

In addition to adding the highest relevant rating to a test, sometimes the ranking is also important and additional effects or rules key off of that.

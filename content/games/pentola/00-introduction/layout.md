There are a few things to note while reading this book.

## Example Text

Examples describing how something should play out will always be rendered like this:

{{< detail example "An Example of an Example" >}}
Example text will be here.
{{< /detail >}}

## Rules Text Details

It will sometimes be necessary to make a note to the reader about the rules text to provide context or let them know where else to look in the book.
These notes will always be rendered like this:

{{< detail note "detail Title" >}}
A summary of the reason for the detail and useful information for the reader.
{{< /detail >}}

## In-World Details

Occasionally, this book will include _in-world_ details—by which we mean these are narrative pieces or information given from the perspective of a person in Pentola.
They will always be rendered like this:

{{< detail inworld "On Pentolan Literacy" >}}
It is often said, especially by those bright scholars of the Aydinlar Empire, that Pentolans have no grasp of letters.
This is, _obviously_, false.

For example, I am a Pentolan, and I'm writing this field guide.

There is, however a grain of truth—the vast and multitudinous population of our city does not, largely, know how to read and write.
Nor do they need to!
Most of them have apprenticed to a Guild or learned the Craft from a family member or friend—and we teach all of our children the _Auratic Vision_ and _Message_ dweomers, of course.

Most Pentolans never learn to read not, as the Aydlinars would have you believe, because their lack of enlightenment leaves them unable to do so, but _simply because it isn't necessary_.

## Game Design Notes

It is useful for us to include notes on the intended design and function of the game—and to help you understand how and why you might alter these rules to suit your table.
They will always be rendered like this:

{{< detail mechanical "Design Concept" >}}
Explanation of concept and how it's intended to work, etc.
{{< /detail >}}

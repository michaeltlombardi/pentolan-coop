This section is a brief overview of (some of) the weird that defines the setting of Pentola.

Pentola is, itself, a megalopolis on the planet Pentolans call Ciambella - a toroidal (donut-shaped) world which has a small moon that oscillates up and down through the planet's center.

## The Planet

Because Ciambella is a toroidal world, it spins _much_ faster than Earth - Pentolans experience three daylight/dark cycles in every 24 hour period!

Directions on a toroidal planet are a bit different from what you might expect on Earth;
instead of north, south, east, and west, Pentolans descirbe their directions as hubward (towards the inside of the planet), rimward (towards the outside of the planet), windward, and leeward respectively.

For example:

- Traveling hubward and into the wind is NE
- Traveling rimward and with the wind is SW

## The Moon

Ciambella's moon bobs up and down through the center hole of the planet.
Pentolans in particular have no name for it, though often think of it or refer to it as "the watchful moon"--culturally, they share a belief in it as a semi-malevolent entity that is aware and do _not_ like being outside under its gaze without the sun to protect them.

At the start of each day, the moon is hidden behind the planet, rising for the first half of the day into the sky.
The horizon from which it rises alternates each day - rimward, then hubward, then rimward, etc.

In the middle of each day, the moon rises to its zenith in the sky, hanging ominously and watchful.
At this time, magic seems to be at its most potent, but demonic entities and servitors are _also_ much more active.

Afterward, the moon sinks back towards the same horizon it rose from until it disappears from sight again.

## Periods of the Day

Pentolans track their days by the presence/absence of the sun and motion of the moon into six periods: bakerslight, tabledark, hopelight, quietdark, lastlight, and slumberdark.

- **Bakerslight:** First period of daylight with no visible moon, during which bakers begin their work and the canals are mostly empty as the world wakes.
- **Tabledark:** First sunless period with slowly rising moon, during which Pentolans typically eat and spend time together before starting their full day.
- **Hopelight:** Middle period of daylight with moon rising to its zenith, during which most folks work and Spiredwellers attend parties and functions.
- **Quietdark:** Middle sunless period with moon falling from its zenith, when magic is most powerful, and the canals and the Undercity are best avoided.
- **Lastlight:** Final daylight period with setting moon and waning magic, during which folks eat their supper before heading to bed or out carousing.
- **Slumberdark:** Final sunless, moonless period, during which folks slumber, carouse til they drop, or make their living when the moon can’t see them.

## The City

Pentola is made up of hundreds of small hilly volcanic islands in a bay along the Sweetwater (a sugared as opposed to salted sea) at the mouth of the Zia river.

It is broken into innumerable rough neighborhoods, many of them dominated by a Spire, a superstructure rising from one of the hills into the sky, left by the Old People.
These neighborhoods are all functionally autonomous and continually in flux;
no single power has even token hegemony over more than a handful of neighborhoods.

The waterways of the city range from ten to dozens of feet deep and are travelled as canals.

The canals, island hills, and floating structures of Pentola cit over the ruined, sunken, or buried sections of the Old City, known as the Undercity, which itself sits above the Catacombs.
Entries to the Undercity are all over the place;
sometimes in town squares, or cave structures, or basements of old buildings.

### The Catacombs

The Catacombs are _literally_ unmappable, seemingly warded by the Old People, such that only professionals who have memorized paths can help others safely and quickly travel them.

Modern Pentolans do not have any particular taboo about exploring these ancient tombs, temples, and other structures and have a bad habit of disturbing them, stealing stuff, breaking things, etc.

{{< detail mechanical "Adventuring in the Catacombs" >}}
While Pentolans don't have taboos about adventuring in the Catacombs, the adventures and first party content touching on them tends to highlight that adventurers are fucking with the rest of real people who had lives and aims to entwine an emotional weight to any such endeavors, not looking away from the problems of this behavior.

## Religion

There’s no fully dominant religion in Pentola, nevermind a one true religion.
Pentola is a Bronze Age megalopolis, stuffed full of a hundred cultures from along the coast and those up the river inland.
There’s innumerable organized religions, small personal religions, and everything in between.
But there isn’t any divine intervention, either.
Whether or not the gods exist is unknown - many folks believe in them, but magic always seems to come back to the Craft, at least for what modern people can accomplish intentionally.

## Trade

Pentola is bustling with trade, super active, a metropolis of mixing and sharing and continual reinvention.
It’s colorful and rich and decadent and terrible and constantly, always changing.
It’s got a little bit of everything and haggling is nearly a sanctioned city sport, especially considering the myriad and byzantine laws and customs of each neighborhood.

## Magic

Ciambella generally and Pentola specifically are _super-saturated_ with magic - it's everywhere, in everything, woven into every aspect of life for everyone.

People are in the midst of unprecedented experimentation and exploration of what is possible as more and more laws of magic (the application of which is known as the Craft) are discovered and shared.
Across the city and the broader world, people race to push the boundaries of what is possible and reinvent their world as they discover ways to do so.

The Craft is something like a cross between applied physics, programming, and art and is deeply entwined in every discipline and vocation of the city.
People can apply dweomers (magic effects) via ritual, off-the-cuff calculations and triggers, and artistic endeavors.

Alchemy is also utterly commonplace, a practical physical application of the Craft.
Alchemical creations aren't _just_ potions, either - they can be snortable, injectable, edible, inhalable, etc.
Pentolans use magic spices on their food, spire agents snort magic powders before going on missions, pirests fill their halls with incense which induces euphoria and visions, etc.

Alchemy is also found in the practices of gardening and husbandry.
In a world where just about everything is magical, you sometimes need to cultivate your own ingredients for alchemical purposes;
or perhaps you just grow flowers that glow and shrubs that sing in the rain, keep birds which predict the temperature or beetles which clean your pipes.
These types of creatures occur naturally too, so there's _plenty_ of weird and interesting life in the city.

Pentolans use a _dozenal_ number system, meaning they count by twelves instead of tens.
When a Pentolan writes the numerals `100` they mean a gross, or `144` in decimal.

{{< detail example "Dozenal in Our World" >}}
Dozenal (also called duodecimal notation) actually existed in numerous places in our own world!
Several Nigerian languages nad the Chepang language of Nepal use duodecimal numerals.

Moreover, twelves are everywhere when you start looking for them---twelve zodiac signs, months, inches in a foot, troy ounces in a troy pound, pence in a shilling, and more!

Some cultures actually count by twelves on their hands, touching their finger bones with their thumb to count each numeral---incredibly, this means you can count to a gross using just your hands!

Why was this so common?
We're not _sure_, but 12 sure is a convenient system for day-to-day counting.

12 is evenly divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6 in addition to itself, whereas 10 is only evenly divisible by 2 and 5.
That means that breaking things into thirds and fourths is actually easier in dozenal systems.

This is perhaps better understood by showing you the faces of a dozenal die, also annotated here as **dz** in increasing value:

- 1
- 2
- 3
- 4
- 5
- 6
- 7
- 8
- 9
- ☀️️️️️️️️️ (ten)
- 🌑 (eleven)
- 0 (twelve)

This die uses a `0` for twelve much like a d10 uses a `0` for ten.
The dozens die is the same, but each face ends in an additional `0`, just like the "tens" die for d100.

As this system uses a d144 (also called dz%)--going from 01-00 in dozenal, much as a d100/d% goes from 01-00 in decimal--it's worth noting that you'll only ever be looking at two numbers and comparing them to something; there's almost no required math in Pentola, **none** in play, just comparisons and table lookups.

The only time you'll do math in dozenal is between sessions to modify your bonuses, and that will always be single digit addition or subtraction.

## Reading a dz%

If 25 in dozenal isn't "twenty-five" what is it?
In practice, what you call it doesn't matter much in play (you're always comparing, not counting), but dozenal reads `25` as "two-do-five"--a shortened way of saying "two-dozen-and-five".

So 4🌑 would be "four-do-moon" and ☀️️️️️️️️️9 would be "sun-do-nine"--though if you just say "four-moon" and "sun-nine" everyone will likely know what you mean.

The other important thing to note is that sometimes the rules will reference the **significant numeral** of a number--this is just the first numeral in the pair, so the significant numeral of 83 is 8.

## Rolling a dz%

So, a quick look at what rolling a dz% looks like is in order.
If you're rolling against a goal of 55, any result of 54 or lower will be a success.
For example:

- 53 is a success
- 29 is a success
- 4🌑 is a success
- 61 is a failure

If your goal is ☀️️️️️️️️️7 then:

- 53 is a success
- 6🌑 is a success
- ☀️️️️️️️️️4 is a success
- 4☀️️️️️️️️️ is a success
- ☀️️️️️️️️️9 is a failure
- 🌑4 is a failure

The main thing to keep in mind with dz% is that numbers are less than symbols and the sun is less than the moon.
Pentolans generally fear the watchful moon, which rises and falls in the sky every day with quiet seeming malevolence.

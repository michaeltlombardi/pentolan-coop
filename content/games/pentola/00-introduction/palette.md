description: Tooling for leaning into or away from Pentola as originally designed
weight: 30

---

This is a broad tool for helping players lean into and away from the setting as originally designed.
You can and _should_ add to and remove from this palette to suit your table.

Anything in the **Yes** section can always be brought in or added, even if you're not sure if it makes sense.
Anything in the **No** section should always be avoided in play.

Definitely and explicitly discuss this palette and any changes you want to make to it as a table.
A firm grasp on what you do/don't want to bring into play is useful.

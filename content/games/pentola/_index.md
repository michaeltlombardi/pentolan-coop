Pentola is a high fantasy game where you play citizens embroiled in intrigue and adventure in a bronze age megalopolis, and where your choices and beliefs shape reality.

Explore a city of incredible magic and unending intrigue above catacombs filled with ancient horrors locked away before an apocalypse hundreds of years in the past.
Take power, become rich, explore the lost city, or sing away the demons from your gondola.

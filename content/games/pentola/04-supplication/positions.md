## Lay Members

Lay members are normal members of the faction.
They regularly attend important factional events and do their best to uphold the strictures of the faction.
In return, the faction protects them as best it can, and its supplicants and principals perform miracles on their behalf.

Lay members _cannot_ perform miracles, although they may acquire low magnitude (no more than magnitude 2) factional knacks.
They have a favor deck with a single suit.

To become a lay member of an faction a character must have relationship with that faction of at least 30.

## Supplicants

Supplicants are members who have dedicated their lives to the tenents of the faction and have undergone the Supplication dweomer.
They always attend important factional events and always uphold the strictures of the faction.
In return, the faction will pay ransoms if they are captured and allow the supplicant to learn to perform miracles.

Supplicants can acquire unlimited magnitude of any factional knack and up to 2 magnitude of any miracle available to the faction.
They have a favor deck with a two suits.

To become a supplicant, a member of an faction must have a Relationship with that faction of at least 46 and have performed a minor duty.

## Principals

Principals are the living embodiment of the faction, instructed by their faction to be its representative in the world.
They lead the events for their faction.
In return, the faction will pay ransoms if they are captured and grant them the inner secrets of their faction.

Principals may acquire any factional knacks or miracles at any magnitude.
They have a favor deck with four suits.

To qualify to become a principal a character must have a Relationship with the faction of at least 90, be a supplicant, have two of the factional skills with a rating of at least 90, and have performed at least three major duties and nine minor ones.

There must be a vacancy in the faction's hierarchy or the principal must be willing and allowed to establish a new chapter.

### Living Miracle

Upon becoming a Principal the character gains a powerful gift from the faction.
This gift is a combination of the changes in the character over the course of becoming a principal and the power that is placed in them on behalf of the faction.

The character immediately gains 6 magnitude worth of factional knacks and 3 magnitude worth of Miracles and their Flax and Iron both increase by one significant numeral.

However, if the Principal ever takes an action that offends the faction, they must pay twice as much as normal from their favor deck and cannot regain them until they've fulfilled a quest of repentence which directly benefits the faction.

## Champions

These are supplicants who have become empowered warriors who protect the locations and members of their faction.
Not all factions have champions, especially those dedicated to non-violent goals, but where they do, these warriors ceaselessly campaign to protect the devoted and punish the faction's enemies.

They have a favor deck with three suits.

The minimum requirement to become a champion is to have relationship with the faction of at least 60, already be a supplicant, and some sort of combat skill rating of 90 or higher.
Additionally, they must have performed at least one major duties and three minor ones.

### Miraculous Panoply

When someone becomes a champion they are gifted a specially consecrated weapon that gives them a bonus when wielded on behalf of the faction.
Tests to attack and parry enemies of the faction are one step easier and the weapon may have additional powers depending on the faction.

They also gain armor which is magically imbued by the faction's grantors.
When checking to see if the armor's rating has been depleted, you may treat the check like an easy test and reverse the result to the more favorable one and the armor may have additional powers depending on the faction.

### Warrior Miracles

Champions may acquire miracles that further enhance their ability to fight on the behalf of the faction at unlimited magnitude.

### Champion Responsibilities

Like principals, champions are expected to uphold the member duties of the faction.
Also, as the faction's warriors they are expected to take up arms against any aggressor who attacks its members or the faction's locations.

## Grantors

Grantors are powerful crafters who are dedicated to the faction.
Instead of wielding power on behalf of the faction, as supplicants do, grantors are the people responsible for pooling power, applying the Supplication dweomer, and, if the faction has champions, for imbuing their panoply.

There is usually no distinct hierarchy of grantors, their place in the faction being more or less related to how much they do for the faction by providing power to supplicants and selecting goals for them that further the faction.

To become a grantor, a character must have relationship with the faction of 60 or higher and a Craft skill of 90 or higher.
Additionally, they must have performed a minor duty.

### Grantor Responsibilities

Grantors, like all members of the faction, must uphold the factional duties.
Additionally, they are responsible for interacting with supplicants, principals, and champions, spending most of their time and power in locations run by factions and investing power into their supplicants and punishing them for crossing the faction.

### Grantor Benefits

Grantors treat all tests with members of the faction as one step easier and can direct supplicants to perform actions on behalf of the faction.
They have a favor deck with three suits.

Grantors may also acquire factional knacks at any magnitude, though they cannot perform miracles.

## The Ritual of Supplication

The ceremony of Supplication is, itself, a dweomer of the Craft, a magical binding contract.
The Supplication dweomer requires that the supplicant truly, honestly want to use power to further the goals of the faction they are supplicating to.
This prevents the supplicant from performing miracles against the faction.
The supplication dweomer sends information back to the grantor(s), allowing them to know why the supplicant chooses to perform any given miracle.
Finally, the dweomer allows the supplicant to communicate with the grantors and receive messages from them in turn.

## Supplicant Duties & The Favor Deck

When a character becomes a lay member of a faction, they gain access to a favor deck for that faction; this deck starts with a single suit of cards and grows with their position in the faction.

Each faction has a set of duties which represent the faction's objectives in the world.

When a character fulfills one of the factional duties they may regain one card spent from their favor deck for a minor act and up to three for a major act.

When a character goes against one of the factional duties they must pay a cost from their favor deck depending on the grievousness of their transgression.
If they cannot pay the cost from their deck then they start to lose miracles gained from the faction.
The player may chose which miracle to lose and, if no miracles remain, they begin to lose factional knacks instead.

If the offending character cannot pay the cost and has no miracles or knacks to lose then they are excommunicated from the faction and may never join it again.

## Factional Positions

There are, broadly speaking, five positions of factional membership: lay members, supplicants, champions, principals, and grantors, each with different expectations and support from the faction.

For more information, see [factional positions](positions).

## Knacks

Dedicating oneself to a faction changes adherents, enabling them to acquire factional knacks.
As with all knacks, the maximum magnitude is limited by their {{< icon tephra>}} but also by their factional position.

The Knacks may be purchased from the favor deck, a Principal of the faction blessing the character and activating the knack that has grown within them... if they truly believe.

## Miracles

Miracles are special abilities which exceed the normal bounds and limitations of the Craft, usable only via the ritual link of supplication.
Attempts to recreate these abilities without supplication have always met with abject failure.

For more information, see [miracles](miracles).

## Intervention

As well as having miracles and allies in the faction that teach them, supplicants also gain the ability to call for intervention.

A character who is a supplicant, principal, or champion can call upon their grantor for intervention whenever they face a desperate situation.
They may even do so in the instant they are killed or knocked unconscious.

When intervention is requested, roll dz%.
If this roll is equal to or less than the character's max {{< icon tephra >}}, the call for aid is answered.
However, grantors demand a price for their help if successful and the character will suffer a permanent loss of one {{< icon tephra >}} and the result from their relationship rating.

Intervention can take many forms and the following can be considered guidelines:

+ Allow the character to perform any factional miracle at any magnitude.
+ Allow a miracle to affect every member of the faction within the character's line of sight.
+ Various other effects are also possible dependant on the nature of the character's faction.
  Examples could include creating a fog to allow the character to escape from enemies, doubling their Bone to defeat a powerful enemy or causing a river to break its banks to stall an invading army.

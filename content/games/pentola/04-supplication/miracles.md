In order to acquire any miracles, the character must be a supplicant, champion, or principal within an faction.
Lay members are not entrusted or empowered with the faction's miracles.

## Acquiring a Miracle

The character must either go to an factional headquarters or commune with their grantor and request to be empowered with a miracle.
They must spend from their favor deck equal to the magnitude for the miracle they wish to acquire.

A character can incrementally improve the magnitude of their miracles by spending from their favor deck during another visit to the headquarters or while communing with their grantor.

## Performing a Miracle

A character must be able to gesture and chant in order to perform a miracle.
Whenever a miracle is performed, there will **always** be a sight and sound that nearby creatures can detect, be it a flash of light, a crack of thunder or a shimmering in the air.
The exact effects are up to the referee and player to decide but will automatically be detected by any creatures who are nearby.

Performing a miracle is automatically successful.
No dice need be rolled, no chance of a botch or critical either.
Miracles do not cost any {{< icon tephra >}} and take only a single action to perform.

A character can dismiss any miracle they have performed as a single action.
Ceasing to perform a concentration miracle is immediate and does not require an action.

Miracles do not stack, only the most powerful effect from overlapping ones applies.

When in a direct contest with either knacks or dweomers, miracles are considered to have double their normal magnitude.

{{< detail mechanical "The Power of Miracles" >}}
Miracles are twice as powerful as other magics when it comes to things like deflecting/negating them.
This means if a miracle has an M3 effect a counter-dweomer would need to be M6 or higher to stop it!

They're also [one-use magics](#perform-once-only), and should be the sort of thing that can and does radically change a conflict or problem space.

### Splitting Magnitude

A character can 'split' a miracle's magnitude into multiple miracles.

For instance, if they know the Absorption miracle at magnitude 3, they may choose to perform it as:

+ a single magnitude 3 miracle
+ three magnitude 1 miracles
+ one magnitude 1 and one magnitude 2 miracle.

The split miracles are treated as separate instances and are performed separately.

### Perform Once Only

Each miracle may be performed only once, after which the character must make contact with a Grantor of the faction and petition them for more power.

Supplicants can generally regain miracles in one of two ways:

1. **Visit an Factional Sanctum Special Event:**
   Most factions will have special events---holy days, annual galas, quarterly celebrations, etc.
   A character attending these events in good standing can make a {{< icon iron >}}-based relationship test---success will entirely replenish their miracles.
2. **Fulfill Factional Goal:**
   For supplicants who perform miracles more frequently, they will find that using miracles in the course of furthering the faction is the best means of being able to continue to perform miracles.
   As well as regaining spent favor deck cards for performing factional duties, miracles are instantly regained.
   Minor deeds regain one or two point miracles, while major deeds regain miracles that cost three points or more.

## Miracle Traits

+ **Area (X):** The miracle is targeted at a single spot and effects everything which is closer than X, which is a distance increment.
+ **Concentration:** The miracle's effects will remain in place so long as the character concentrates on it.
  Concentrating on a miracle is functionally identical to performing the miracle, requiring the character to continue to gesture with both arms, chant, and ignore distractions.
+ **Duration (X):** The miracle's effects will stay in place for the time indicated.
+ **Instant:** The miracle's effects take place instantly. The miracle itself then disappears.
+ **Magnitude (X):** The minimum strength and power of the miracle.
  If not listed, the minimum magnitude is 1.
+ **Permanent:** The miracle's effects remain in place until they are dispelled or dismissed.
+ **Progressive:** This indicates that the miracle can be acquired and performed at greater levels of Magnitude than the minimum.
+ **Ranged (X):** Ranged miracles may be cast upon targets up to the distance increment specified.
+ **Resist:** The miracle's effects do not take effect automatically.
  The target may make a hard opposed Iron test in order to avoid the effect of the miracle entirely.
+ **Dodge:** The miracle's effects do not take effect automatically.
  The target may make a hard opposed test (their Bone vs the supplicant's Iron) in order to avoid the effect of the miracle entirely.
  Note that the target must be able to use their reaction in order to dodge.
  In the case of area miracles, the Dodge trait requires the target to dive in order to mitigate the miracle's effect.
+ **Touch:** Touch miracles require the character to actually touch their target for the miracle to take effect.
  The supplicant must remain in physical contact with the target for the entire application of the miracle.

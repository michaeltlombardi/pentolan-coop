{{< detail inworld "On Gondolieri Dweomersongs" >}}
While our own people have produced many incredible artists in whose work the magic is undeniable, no peoples pursue the twinning of craft and art as seriously and prolifically as the Pentolans.

The most noticeable pursuers of this art are the gondolieri, the folk who guard and guide travelers of the canal in their gondolas.
The gondolieri are heard long before they are seen, singing dweomersongs of their own making which ward off demons and provide other effects.

detail from a few traditional songs, no Gondolieri would be caught dead singing the song of another.
It is a point of great pride and competition between them to invent ever more complex and powerful songs.
This uniqueness has another purpose though - it seems that while their songs ward off the monstrous denizens of the canals, any two gondolieri singing the same song will serve to _summon_ those creatures, not ward them off.

In any case, after spending several years amongst these peoples I can say one thing with certain:
It is only the singing of the gondolieri which makes traveling their city any kind of joy, assuming you can stand their fanciful experiments with the human voice.

Actualizing an ethereal opus requires that the crafter knows it---either they devised it themself, were taught it, or otherwise learned it.
Doing so requires the crafter to spend a number of minutes and {{< icon tephra >}} equal to complexity to perform.

It takes effect either at completion (starting the duration clock), or begins immediately but lasts only for so long as the performance does, depending on the opus.

If the test to actualize the opus is failed, the {{< icon tephra >}} is still expended.
If it is botched, there is also an unintended or backfiring effect.

While ethereal performances may not always be useful while adventuring - enemies will rarely wait around while you recite a poem - they are particularly useful in intrigue and social situations.

It's also a good idea to encourage characters to think up other ethereal performance ideas - battle dances, warsongs, music played with their armor, etc.
It can make the game feel more distinct and strange, a feeling Pentola was written to lean into.

### Devising an Ethereal Opus

Each opus researched devised making one or more experiments, each of which require:

1. A full day's worth of work to prepare and attempt without distractions
1. You must expend all of your {{< icon tephra >}} in the attempt, the process drawing from your every reserve.
1. A successful crafting test
   + The test is one step harder if being researched without notes or materials defining the effect.
   + The test is one step easier if being aided by someone else who knows the effect of the opus.

After each successful experiment, roll a dz:

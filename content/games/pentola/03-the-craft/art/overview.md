In Pentola, the overlap of artistic endeavors and the Craft itself is so large as to make the distinction nearly meaningless.
While alchemist's toil in their laboratories and crafters pour over books and symbols, artists design in their studios, using their knowledge and skill to bring about effects in the world via the creation of _opuses_.
Of the three approaches to the Craft, the arts are the most flexible and personal.

When crafters apply dweomers through their art---physical (sculptures, paintings, architecture, etc) and ethereal (songs, poems, dances, etc.)---they are actualizing an opus which acts as a separately applied dweomer.
If the opus can be experienced without the artist actively participating, it is _physical_; otherwise it is _ethereal_.

When devising and actualizing opuses, artisans use their specific art rating instead of Crafting for both their tests and determining maximum complexity.
Note that this means an artisan may be able to create more complex opuses with one type of art than another.

Except as noted, actualizing opuses follows the same rules and steps as ritually applying dweomers.

As with dweomers, though the basic effects of a dweomer are relatively fixed, they can be manipulated each time you actualize the opus---almost no work of art is ever really _exactly_ the same.

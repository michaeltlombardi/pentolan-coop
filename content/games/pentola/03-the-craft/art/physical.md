Actualizing a physical opus requires that the crafter knows it---either they devised it themself, were taught it, or otherwise learned it---as well as gathering appropriate materials (typically, the materials should have a total cost equal to the complexity of the opus being actualized).
The time to actualize a physical opus depends on the ranking at which you have it trained:

+ **Nominal:** Complexity weeks
+ **Basic:** Complexity days
+ **Comprehensive:** Complexity twilights
+ **Extraordinary:** Complexity hours
+ **Incredible:** Complexity quarter hours
+ **Unbelievable:** Complexity minutes

No additional Crafting test is needed to trigger the effect---the creation is, itself, a dweomer.
If the test is a failure, half the materials are wasted.
If a botch, all of them are.

Once actualized, the art is empowered with the opus' effects until it is destroyed.
Physical opuses may also have a specific trigger (someone coming Close to it, or speaking in front of it, or being in love, etc), only taking effect after then.

Many characters will tend towards physical art because it allows you to save up one or more effects for later use.
Physical art with triggers is particularly useful in this regard.

For refs, it might be tempting to provide counters for this flexibility and utility, but you should not.
Much of Pentola's balance and feel depends on rewarding clever play and preparation by players and characters.
Players remember negating challenges by clever play much more fondly than they do being nullified for the referee's convenience.

## Devising a Physical Opus

Each opus researched devised making one or more experiments, each of which require:

1. A full day's worth of work to prepare and attempt without distractions
1. Materials necessary for your experiment (paints, marble, bronze, whatever), minimum 1V
1. A successful crafting test
   + The test is one step harder if being researched without notes or materials defining the effect.
   + The test is one step easier if being aided by someone else who knows the effect of the opus.

After each successful experiment, roll a dz:

## Physical Opuses as Magic Items

It is also possible for a crafter to make an item whose effects are specific and permanent---e.g. a pair of greaves which can be activated daily, or headscarf which dyes the wearer's hair a particular shade if worn overnight, etc---in these cases, the creation of the item for the first time follows the same rules as researching a dweomer, as the manipulations are fixed to an exact degree.

Afterwards, a crafter can create a copy of a magic item they have already created as if making physical art as normal.

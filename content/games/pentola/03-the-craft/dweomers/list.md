title: Dweomers & Traits

There are two broad categories of dweomers in Pentola, [routine](#routine-dweomers) and [secret](#secret-dweomers).
The differences are largely in recognizability; they share the same list of traits as detailed below:

- **Concentration:** The dweomer's effects will remain in place as long as the character concentrates on it, instead of the duration being determined via manipulation.
  Concentrating on a dweomer is functionally identical to applying the dweomer, requiring the Crafter to continue to gesture with both arms, chant and ignore distractions.
- **Instant:** The dweomer's effects take place instantly, instead of the duration being determined via manipulation.
  The dweomer itself then disappears.
- **Permanent:** The dweomer's effects remain in place until they are dispelled or dismissed, instead of the duration being determined via manipulation.
- **Resist:** The dweomer's effects do not take effect automatically.
  The target may make an opposed Iron test in order to avoid the effect of the dweomer entirely.
- **Dodge:** The dweomer's effects do not take effect automatically.
  The target may make an opposed test (their Bone vs the crafter's Iron) in order to avoid the effect of the dweomer entirely.
  Note that the target must be able to use their reaction in order to dodge.
  In the case of area dweomers, the Dodge trait requires the target to dive in order to mitigate the dweomer's effect.
- **Touch:** Touch dweomers require the character to actually touch his target for the dweomer to take effect, instead of the range being determined via manipulation.
  The crafter must remain in physical contact with the target for the entire application of the dweomer.

## Routine Dweomers

There is a long, long list of known dweomers whose application is known as a **routine**, repeatable and recognizable no matter the crafter applying it.

When creating a new character, roll on the following table once per SN of your Crafting skill (or pick from the list).
You start with those dweomers at a rating of 6 and can apply them as an action, if you choose.

Note that many dweomers have two opposite uses (such as _Holdfast / Repel_): if a crafter learns this dweomer they can choose which of the two ways they wish to apply it _at_ application.

Some dweomers have a word in parentheses, like _Illusory (Sense)_.
These dweomers are a single entry for numerous, related dweomers, one for each possible value for the word in parentheses.
In the case of _Illusory Sense_, there's a series of dweomers, each of which the crafter would need to learn separately:

- Illusory Sight
- Illusory Smell
- Illusory Taste
- Illusory Touch
- Illusory Sound

Use your best judgement for which values fit a particular dweomer and consult with the table and your referee if ambiguous.

{{< detail mechanical "Creative Uses" >}}
In addition the stated description it is _strongly encouraged_ that you use dweomers in varied and creative ways.
Very few formulaic dweomers directly cause damage to targets but almost any dweomer can be used offensively or creatively while adventuring.

If there's an effect which makes sense given the dweomer's description the referee should err on the side of allowing for creative solutions and uses and adjudicate as neccessary.

## Secret Dweomers

There are hundreds more dweomers known to the denizens of Pentola, and thousands more besides - but most of those dweomers are known only to a select few who guard their knowledge jealously, teaching only those they trust - or those who pay a high enough price.
In Pentola, belonging to a specific organization at a high enough level sometimes grants you access to specific dweomers, or apprenticing to another Crafter.

Like the formulaic dweomers above, these can be learned from books and teachings and passed down to future Crafters.
Secret dweomers can even be researched, creating wholly new dweomers or recreating the effects of ones only observed.
Secret dweomers are otherwise just like formulaic dweomers in every meaningful way.

{{< detail mechanical "Secret Dweomers & Factions" >}}
Part of the purpose of keeping the list of dweomers in this section small is to emphasize that every organization has different needs and focuses - and so they research and teach particular dweomers.

Magic in Pentola is vast and varied, and there should be dozens of dweomers unique to a particular Crafter or organization.
The common dweomers are the sort of thing that shouldn't be surprising or particularly wondrous to behold - the strange and surprising dweomers should be researched and taught - and therefore known - by a smaller number of people.

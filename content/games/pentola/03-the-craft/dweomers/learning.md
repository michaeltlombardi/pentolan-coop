title: Learning Dweomers
type: chapter
weight: 30
---

In order to learn a particular dweomer, the character must possess the dweomer in written form, be taught it by a teacher.
Barring that, experiments are the best way to learn a new dweomer.
If you don't want to memorize it, simply having it on hand is enough to be able to ritually apply it.

To memorize a new dweomer you must spend [research](#researching-dweomers) it.
Doing so grants you that dweomer as a special skill at a base rating of 6.
This skill may be improved normally though use and practice during downtime.

All Crafters also have the Craft skill itself; even non-Crafters have this skill, at a base rating of 10, since magic knowledge is widespread and simple spells are often used by normal folk---and nearly everyone in the civilized world interacts with magic items on occasion.

Once the dweomer has been learned, the character will be ready to try applying it.

## Researching Dweomers

Researching dweomers covers two related activities: trying to learn and memorize formulaic or secret dweomers and trying to solve for and define dweomers with new effects.

In either case, these activities involve experimentation, reading, and extensive math and metaphysical thinking.

Each dweomer researched requires making one or more experiments, each of which require:

1. A full day's worth of work to prepare and attempt without distractions
1. A successful crafting test
   - The test is one step harder if being researched without notes or materials defining the dweomer.
   - The test is one step easier if being aided by someone else who knows the dweomer.

After each successful experiment, roll a dz:

{{< detail example "Researching a Dweomer" >}}
Taryn wants to learn how to apply a dweomer they saw referenced once in the biography of a mage - the effect was described as "filling the room with thunder and shaking the very stones apart with voice alone."

Between the player and referee, the effect is determined to be the infliction of M damage caused by sonic waves from the crafter and can destroy solid objects which it comes in contact with (opposed test if targeting a living creature or magical object).

They then spend two half-days preparing for the experiment (Taryn has work, they can't just skip it to learn a dweomer).
Then Taryn is ready to try the experiment and makes a hard Crafting test and succeeds.
Taryn rolls a dz with a result of a 5 - though they didn't learn everything they needed to from the experiment, Taryn can repeat it after another day's preparation without it being a hard test.

Two days later, Taryn tries again and succeeds in the experiment, rolling a dz and getting a ðŸŒ‘!
Taryn has successfully learned _Thunderspeech_, a new dweomer which allows Taryn to project their voice to destroy obstacles and injure enemies.

{{< detail mechanical "Researching and Balance" >}}
When creating new dweomers, specific is always better than general, and it's best to create unique effects rather than trying to think of bigger, stronger versions of known dweomers - that's what manipulations are for!

The common formulaic dweomers are as generalized as dweomers should get.

If you'd like to make learning dweomers easier and faster, you could just allow a crafter to learn a new one by spending a downtime action.

Note also that the way the rules are written it's mostly a matter of time until the crafter learns a dweomer, but it's not a steady march of progress.
You could instead use clocks (a three section clock, or five, or whatever), and have each successful experiment advance the clock by one step.

If implementing clocks, I suggest setting the clock size by crafter ranking:

+ 5 for basically skilled crafters
+ 4 for comprehensively skilled crafters
+ 3 for extraordinarily skilled crafters
+ 2 for incredibly  skilled crafters
+ 1 for unbelievably skilled crafters

{{< detail mechanical "Converting Vancian Spells" >}}
Vancian styled leveled arcane spells can be used mostly as-is in Pentola with the following guidelines:

+ Vancian spells can't be manipulated unless they're the sort that allows for damage / effects based on character level, in which case use Magnitude as normal instead.
+ The effective magnitude of the Vancian spell turned dweomer is the spell level.
+ The effective total complexity of the Vancian spell turned dweomer is double the spell level.
+ If the spell allows for anything other than a reflex or dodge save, use the Resist trait.
+ Pentola lacks healing and regenerative magic, resurrection magic should be costly and dangerous if it works at all.
+ Cantrips and 0-th level spells count as complexity and magnitude 1.
+ These are guidelines, the referee (as usual) has the final say in a conversion.

> Dweomers are the most common form of intentional application of the Craft in Pentola.
> They're a way of pulling the metaphysical levers and turning the knobs of reality to bring around specific changes in the world.
> Used by carpenters, clockmakers, bakers, soldiers, sailors, thieves, lawyers, trebuchet operators, and more, dweomers are ubiquitous, found even in the minds of children.
>
> When someone takes a dweomer they know and uses it to override reality, Pentolans call this _applying_ the dweomer.

While technically still part of the Craft, alchemists may choose to apply dweomers as alchemical formulae using their Alchemy skill bonus instead of their Crafting one.

Except as noted below, applying dweomers through alchemy follows the same rules and steps as ritually applying dweomers.

Once an alchemist has acquired a formula by learning or experimentation, they are free to attempt to prepare a batch of that formula using their alchemy skill.
To do so they must acquire the appropriate ingredients, spend one hour per magnitude of the formula, and make a normal alchemy test.

Failure wastes the ingredients but is otherwise safe unless the test is botched, in which case a mishap occurs.

Unlike dweomers, the magnitude, delay, duration, and batch size of each formula is fixed, determined when the formula was first discovered.

Preparing a batch of a formula then is _"just"_ a matter of gathering the necessary ingredients, spending the time to prepare them, and not failing your alchemy test!

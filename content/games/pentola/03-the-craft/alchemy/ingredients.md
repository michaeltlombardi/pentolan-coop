- **Anatomical:** All formulae which modify or influence the body require and ingredient with this quality.
- **Base:** All formulae require at least one ingredient with this quality.
- **Elemental (Element):** All formulae which project or manipulate a particular element require an ingredient with the appropriate elemental quality.
- **Expensive:** Ingredients with this quality are costly and have their value increased by 1.
- **Imported:** Ingredients with this quality cannot be obtained normally in Pentola and must be purchased from traders from afar and therefore have their value increased by 1.
- **Material:** All formulae which empower the wielder to control or create physical objects require an ingredient with this quality.
- **Metaphysical:** All formulae which directly empower the recipient to see, manipulate, or otherwise interact with raw magic require this ingredient.
- **Destructive:** All formulae which do harm dequire an ingredient with this quality.
- **Mindful:** All formulae which affect the mind require an ingredient with this quality.
- **Potent:** For every five magnitude of an intended alchemical preparation you must include an additional ingredient with this quality.
- **Rare:** Ingredients with this quality are hard to come by, if they can be bought at all and therefore have their value increased by 1, if they can be found.

In Pentola, alchemists don't just make items to be ingested, inhaled, or injected, nor do they always limit themselves to purchasing ingredients with the necessary qualities.

Many alchemists also practice alchemical gardening and husbandry, skills which intertwine knowledge of alchemy, the Craft, and the cultivation of flora and fauna.
Through these endeavors alchemists are able to raise wonders like bushes whose fruit get you drunk, tubers which glow brightly in the dark, birds which can act as diction recorders, fish whose blood is extremely acidic, and more.

> To be detailed further; for now, treat as research similar to other alchemical pursuits to discover a new strain, with double the cost and mishaps being weird failures along the way rather than dangerous ones.
> Use the _Gardening_ and _Husbandry_ skills instead of Alchemy for any related tests.

> Referees should err on the side of letting the players dream up and try interesting and weird experiments, but use their best judgement;
> the more dangerous or useful the creation, the slower it should grow and/or the more expensive and tedious it's care.

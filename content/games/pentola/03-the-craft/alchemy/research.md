Researching an alchemical formula for a dweomer (as opposed to learning one from a book or teacher or other source) is somewhat dangerous and expensive.

The magnitude of an alchemical formula is determined by the researcher, but the delay, duration, and batch size are determined when your experiment to discover a new formula is successful.
You can always attempt to research an alternate formula for the same effect, choosing whether or not to change out the ingredients.
Even if the ingredients are the same, the difference will be in the specific ratios and procedures.

Each dweomer researched requires making one or more experiments, each of which require:

1. A [form]() for the formula to take---pills, wafers, salves, potions, powders, incense---what makes a good and usable incense does not (necessarily) make a good potion.
1. The appropriate ingredients---each formula requires the combination of two or more [ingredients]() whose [qualities]() matches the effect being created.
1. A full day's day's work to prepare and attempt without distractions
1. A successful hard alchemy test
   - The test is one step easier if you or someone aiding you knows another magnitude of the same effect.
   - Note that failure during research is _especially dangerous_, like action crafting under duress.
     When you fail during research, roll once on the [Alchemical Mishap table](#alchemical-mishaps).
     The potency of any effects caused by a mishap is equal to the intended magnitude of the formula.

If successful, compare your dz% result to this table:

### Forms

- **Pills:** must be ingested to take effect and do so in 1-4 hours, lasting for a full day, in batches of 1-6.
  Their magnitude degrades by one per month.
- **Wafers:** must be ingested to take effect and do so in 1-4 minutes, lasting for 1-6 hours, in batches of 1-4.
  Their magnitude degrades by one per week.
- **Salves:** must come in contact with the bare skin to take effect and do so in 1-6 moments, lasting for 15-60 minutes, in batches of 1-6.
  Their magnitude degrades by one per day.
- **Potions:** must be drunk to take effect and do so in 2 moments, lasting for an hour, in batches of 1-4.
  Their magnitude degrades by one per day if not stoppered.
- **Powders:** must be snorted to take effect and do so immediately, lasting for 1-6 moments, in batches of 1-6 snorts.
  The magnitude of the powder degrades by one per day.
- **Incense:** must be burned and inhaled to take effect and does so in 1-4 moments, lasting for 1-6 hours, in batches of 1-6 caps.
  The magnitude of the incense degrades by one per week.

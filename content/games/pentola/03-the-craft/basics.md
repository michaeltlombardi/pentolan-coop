Practitioners of the Craft (generally) develop in one of two ways:

- The majority belong (at least initially) to academic institutions or other factions, which have their own books of dweomers and rules that they teach their apprentices.
- There is a long tradition of crafters working in solitude to focus purely on their magical activities.
  Occasionally they take on an apprentice to teach or use as a helping hand.

When Crafters apply their Craft, they do so in one of a few ways:

1. Through formulaic applications involving equations and channeled thoughts, known as **dweomers**.
   These dweomers are loosely equivalent to physics equations or computer programs.
1. Though the use of art and intention combined with knowledge of the craft to produce effects, known as the actualization of an **opus**.
   In Pentola there is little difference between art and magic---no distinction is made as the craft itself is considered an art.
1. Through formulaic applications involving ingredients and ceremony, known as alchemical **formulae**.
   Practitioners of the craft who specialize in applying it through items - potions, salves, powders, etc - are known as alchemists.

## Ranks

There are three general ranks of crafters in Pentola, though specific organizations may have different ranks or requirements:

- **Apprentice:** Students of the Craft who will only know a couple of dweomers whose Crafting skill rating is at least 30.
  As well as being taught the Craft, they are expected to spend half of their time working for their tutors by performing menial tasks in their magical laboratories or other jobs that their teachers don't have time for or which will help the students grow.
- **Wright:** Graduates of an institution.
  They tend to know between five and ten dweomers, and have a Crafting skill rating ranging from 60 to 90.
  If a member of an organization, they will be expected to spend a third of their time performing duties for it, such as teaching apprentices or recovering lost magical knowledge.
- **Magus/Alchemist/Artisan:** Acknowledged experts of the Craft.
  Magi specialize in dweomers, alchemists in alchemy, and artisans in art.
  They know at least ten dweomers and a have a Crafting skill bonus of 91 or higher.
  If a member of an academic organization then they will often serve on its ruling body and have the complete resources of the organization at their command.
  In return they are expected to spend almost all of their time researching, teaching, and performing missions on their faction's behalf.

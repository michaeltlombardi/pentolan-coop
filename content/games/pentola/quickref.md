## Testing

1. Use base characteristic or highest relevant rating as goal
1. Roll under goal on **dz%** to succeed
1. If one's place is under the SN of goal, succeed.

+ **Easy Tests:** may swap results to be more favorable (91 becomes 19)
+ **Hard Tests:** _must_ swap results to be **less** favorable
+ **Triumph:** if SN of result is 0 and ones is < relevating rating's SN
+ **Botch:** if result is 00

### Opposed Tests

+ **One successful, rest fail:** Successful character's intentions are fulfilled
+ **More than one succeed:** Character who succeeded with highest result wins
+ **None succeed:** Character with highest non-botch result wins

### Initiative Tests

1. All contestants make opposed {{< icon flax >}} test
1. Contestants declare intended actions/reactions _from worst to best_ result
1. Actions are adjudicated in **reverse**, starting with the last action declared

## Action Time

+ **Moments** last ~3s, during which you can take **one each** action & reaction.
+ Forego action for an extra reaction & vice versa without any penalty.
+ Take extra actions/reactions but all tests are one step harder each time
+ Forego action or reaction to focus on other, making the test one step easier.

### Combat Actions & Reactions

Actions are not limited to this list, but these are the most common actions:

+ Attack: Attempt to harm target, inflict singles die in damage if successful
+ Move: move to somewhere close each moment in addition to any other actions; forego action to move somewhere near; forego action & reaction to go somewhere distant
+ Parry: opposed bone test; if successful, reduce damage by ones die of result
+ Dodge: hard opposed bone test; may fling self to ground to make test one step easier
+ Block: easy opposed bone test to ignore attack but decrease shield rating one SN
+ Other Actions: should be ruled sensibly and consistently

## Ambitions

Record a short ambition within the first hour of each session; if completed, roll dz% vs the characteristic most vital in achieving it:

+ if over current rating, +2
+ if equal to current rating, +6
+ if under current rating, +1

Long term ambitions can unlock knacks specific to each ambition.

## Reputations & Skills

+ **Reputations:** mark when affection action is witnessed (left if negative, right if positive)
+ **Skils:** mark to the right when used to pass a normal/hard test

After adventure, marks cancel out 1:1, roll for remaining marks:

+ Marks to the left decrease rating by 4 if result is **under** current rating
+ Marks to the left increase rating by 4 if result is **over** current rating

## Relationships

Mark left when you fail an ally/dependent/faction or ignore enemy threat;
mark right when you help ally/dependent/faction or thwart/are thwarted by enemy.

After adventure, roll like a reputation.

| Type      | Advantages                          | Disadvantages |
|:---------:|:------------------------------------|:--------------|
| Ally      | fiscal aid, info, jobs, intros, etc | need favors, inherit enemies
| Dependent | relevent when supporting            | get in trouble, targeted by enemies
| Enemy     | relevent when thwarting             | try to harm, social interactions harder
| Faction   | facilities/services, info/employ    | need favors, inherit enemies

## Wealth & Equipment

+ **Buying:** pay cost >= value of item from wealth deck; possible to overpay
+ **Selling:** when selling may choose to do one of the following:
  + randomly draw one card from your spend wealth pile
  + select any number of cards from your spent wealth pile totaling <=1/2 the sale value
  + opt to be paid a favor card
  + barter for something else entirely
+ **Losing Wealth:** If you ever run out of cards in your deck entirely, drop to next lowest wealth rank & gain new deck with appropriate number of suits.
+ **Gaining Wealth:** Spend downtime to invest cards from deck, total value is your chance to go upa wealth level on a dz%, rolled at end of next downtime. Cumulative.
+ **Item Ratings:** Some items have ratings; when sensible or indicated, roll dz%---if over current rating, reduce SN by one. Rendered useless at 0.
  + **Armor:** roll after battle if you take damage it does not negate
  + **Shields:** reduce SN by one after each successful block
  + **Weapons:** roll after battle if used to parry successfully
  + **Ammo:** roll after battle if used; failure indicates unrecoverable ammo

## Knacks

Require no test to exercise unless opposed, in which case make opposed {{< icon iron >}} test.

To exercise, spend {{< icon tephra >}} or {{< icon blood >}}:

1. Spend M {{< icon tephra >}} to exercise a knack's standard effect
1. To exercise with an alternate effect, describe desired effect & ref specifies cost
1. If out of {{< icon tephra >}} you may spend {{< icon blood>}} instead at 1:1 cost

Unless otherwise specified a knack:

+ deals M damage if instantaneous
+ modifies by 1/2M (min 1) if effecting other damage
+ modifies rating SN by M if effecting it actively
+ modifies rating SN by 1/2M if effecting it passively
+ if no effects otherwise improve, increase SN for imposed tests by M
